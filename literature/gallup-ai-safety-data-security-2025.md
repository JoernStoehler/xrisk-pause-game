## Overall Safety Priority

### Safety Over Speed

- **80% of U.S. adults** believe "the government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security, even if it means developing AI capabilities more slowly"
- **Only 9%** prioritize rapid development over safety measures
- **11%** are unsure

### Cross-Party Consensus

Strong bipartisan support for safety prioritization:

- **62%** believe the government (not businesses) should take the lead
- **Only 34%** support business-led national security oversight

### Responsibility Across Sectors

Americans believe government should regulate AI use in:
- Hiring decisions

## Key Insights for the AI CEO Game

1. **Safety-First Mandate**: Public strongly prefers precaution over speed—safety regulations have near-universal support
2. **Trust Deficit**: Extremely low baseline trust in AI systems (only 2% fully trust), even among users
3. **Bipartisan Foundation**: Safety and independent testing have rare cross-party agreement
4. **Multi-Stakeholder Preference**: Public wants shared oversight across government, business, and independent experts
5. **Specific Application Sensitivity**: High-stakes applications (hiring, vehicles, medical) drive concerns more than AI generally
