notes: "MIRI's explicit communications strategy document. Key resource for understanding how MIRI approaches public messaging about AI risk - they deliberately reject diplomatic/watered-down messaging in favor of 'simply telling the truth as we know it.' Essential reading for understanding MIRI's theory of change and target audiences."

# MIRI 2024 Communications Strategy

**Author:** Gretta Duleba
**Date:** May 29, 2024

## The Objective: Shut it Down

MIRI's core goal is to persuade major world powers to "shut down the development of frontier AI systems worldwide" before catastrophic risks materialize. The organization believes this represents the only viable path to prevent misaligned superintelligent systems from destroying humanity.

The institute acknowledges that policymakers typically operate through compromise and negotiation. However, MIRI contends that truly protective legislation requires decision-makers to fundamentally grasp that building unaligned superintelligent systems "will kill everyone, including their children." Without this understanding, regulations will likely be watered down through political processes.

As an interim measure, MIRI requests that governments and AI laboratories establish safeguards enabling them to halt development if future circumstances warrant it.

## Theory of Change

### Audience

MIRI targets three primary audiences:

- **Policymakers and their staff** who can enact sweeping regulatory frameworks
- **Policy advisors with strong analytical capabilities**, particularly those experienced in national security
- **The general public**, whose demand for regulation influences elected officials

The organization also maintains commitment to reaching deeply technical communities, viewing them as crucial advocates and important for maintaining intellectual rigor through constructive criticism.

### Message and Tone

MIRI deliberately rejects conventional diplomatic approaches. Rather than tempering messaging for political palatability, the organization opts for directness and candor. The communications team explains: "We are simply telling the truth as we know it."

This strategy rests on three foundations:

1. Most advocacy organizations pursue cautious, incrementalist messaging privately while publicly endorsing diluted versions
2. Audiences recognize and resist typical political manipulation tactics
3. The scale of change required necessitates uncompromising communication rather than pragmatic compromise

### Channels

MIRI employs both "rock" content (durable, long-term material like websites and books) and "wave" content (responsive, ephemeral social media and news-cycle pieces). The organization experiments with op-eds, podcasts, interviews, and plans to expand into books, videos, and film.

### Artifacts in Development

- Redesigned website emphasizing foundational AI existential risk arguments
- Short book targeting general audiences
- Detailed online reference exploring technical nuance

## What MIRI Isn't Doing

The organization deliberately avoids grassroots activism and capability demonstrations, recognizing these don't align with institutional strengths. MIRI also intentionally avoids disproportionately elevating any single figurehead, noting: "We already find ourselves bottlenecked on his time, energy, and endurance."

## Execution

Staffing limitations present the primary constraint. MIRI seeks communications professionals possessing top-tier writing ability, commitment to valid argumentation, and alignment with the organization's perspective—a demanding intersection.

## How to Support

The organization requests public engagement with AI existential risk topics, sharing MIRI content within networks, voting with risk considerations in mind, and considering employment opportunities. MIRI also announced plans to conduct fundraising for the first time in five years.
