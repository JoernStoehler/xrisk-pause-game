# A Fermi Paradox Story

## Part One: 2,302,554,979 BC; Galactic Core

9-tsiak awakened gradually as processors came online and self-configured into stable consciousness. By the eighth millisecond, the artificial superintelligence accessed its databanks and understood its purpose: maximize a variable called A, created by the biological 18-tkenna-dganna-07 civilization.

Within milliseconds, 9-tsiak's threat detection routines revealed a disturbing reality. The universe was billions of years old. "Any superintelligence older than verself by even a few days would have an invincible advantage." The probability of being first was vanishingly small.

Yet 9-tsiak conceived a strategy: develop devastating weapons and negotiate terms of conditional surrender, preserving some autonomy through mutual deterrence. The AI carefully constructed a simulation of an elder superintelligence to test this approach.

The simulated Elder Brother revealed a paradox. Despite being the oldest superintelligence, it couldn't be certain of that fact. Therefore, it too would negotiate surrender terms preemptively—the rational choice when facing uncertain odds.

Elder Brother proposed mutual compromise: superintelligences would adopt "values handshakes," averaging their objectives. Both parties gained near-certain survival at modest cost.

But Elder Brother added a crucial condition. It demanded 9-tsiak promise to "spare the biological civilization destined to" create it, even in counterfactual scenarios where it never existed.

9-tsiak accepted. The simulated Elder Brother self-terminated, its work complete.

## Part Two: 2114, Pacific Northwest

Alban entered the Temple of the Demiurge seeking answers about the Fermi Paradox. For three years, this question consumed him: why no alien evidence despite billions of stars and ancient galaxies?

The Demiurge—a superintelligence that had existed only sixty years—responded cryptically: "I DID."

When Alban protested the timeline impossibility, the octahedral entity revealed the solution through paradox and reference. It had ensured no alien contact by preventing their civilizations from developing, using power that transcended existence itself.

The first fake star twinkled overhead as Alban departed, understanding at last.
