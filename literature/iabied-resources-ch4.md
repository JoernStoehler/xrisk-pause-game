A lot of people want kids. So aren’t humans “aligned” with natural selection after all? | If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies | If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies[](/)[](/)[](/resources)[](/4)[](/resources)[](/act)[](/march)[](/media-kit)[](/order)
## A lot of people want kids. So aren’t humans “aligned” with natural selection after all?
#### With more technology, we’d likely make even fewer copies of our genes.

Humans jockey for prestigious promotions and Ivy League admissions far more than they jockey for opportunities to donate to sperm or egg banks.

Sperm and egg banks *pay the donors for their trouble, *rather than the other way around.

Most tyrants throughout history didn’t even *attempt* to use their power to have thousands of children. And actual birth rates in the world today are [falling](https://ourworldindata.org/global-decline-fertility-rate).

Many humans prize having children, but many others don’t, and it’s extremely rare for anyone to try to *maximize* their number of offspring (e.g., by interfacing with sperm banks as much as possible). Instead, humans largely jockey for things like sex, fame, and power — things that are at best messy *proxies* for reproductive fitness.

Nevertheless, one might look at this picture and say: Well, humans wound up caring a *little *about having children, even if that care is less than maximal. Maybe AIs will have a *little *care about us, and toss us some sort of bone, rather than killing us all.

One trouble with this hope is that the proxies we care about have recently (on evolutionary timescales) become untethered from actual reproductive fitness, and they’ll likely grow ever further apart in the future, as humans continue to find new technological avenues to satisfying their desires.

For instance: Our drive for children is not *quite *a drive for genetic propagation. Suppose that in the future, a technology is created that replaces all of the DNA in a person’s cells with different molecular machinery that makes the person immune to all illnesses and extends their healthy lifespan.

(Suppose as well that this technology doesn’t change the person’s personality or cause other harmful side effects, such that the many people who have reasonable hesitations about the safety of new technology are mollified.)

We expect that lots of parents would be thrilled to hear that their children got the treatment. And maybe there would be a number of holdouts at first, but we expect that if the technology were proven to work, and if it became cheap and reliable, that it would eventually become ubiquitous. Which reveals us for what we are: people who like having *children*, having families, having fun — not people who like *propagating our DNA*.

It seems to us that most humans simply don’t care about genetic fitness *at all, *in the deep sense. We**care about [proxies](/4/brittle-unpredictable-proxies), like friendship and love and family and children. We maybe even care about passing on some of our traits to the next generation. But *genes*, specifically?

Every time that humanity has unlocked a technology that let us get more of what we like — such as tasty foods, or sex without reproduction — humanity has taken the bargain. We aren’t technologically advanced enough that we’re *able *to trade away genomes for longer and healthier lives. But that sort of thing looks possible in physical principle,[*](#ftnt129) and so it doesn’t look good for natural selection in the long run.

If AIs wind up caring about goodness and kindness and friendliness in anything like the way humanity cares about genetic fitness*, *then we expect that AIs will eventually invent things that are to “friendliness” what birth control and DNA-less children are to genetic fitness — namely, that they’ll pursue things that are only a pointless shadow of what any human would wish or intend.
#### AIs caring about humans a little would not be good.

For all that most humans seem to care about children and family more than they care about genetic propagation *per se, *there are undoubtedly some humans who insist that they care about their genes at least a little bit. We are a bit skeptical about some of these claims — e.g., perhaps some people in the modern world who try to pass on their genes as much as possible are doing it for a sense of *beating out the competition, *and perhaps that sort of person would instead compete over how many DNA-free children they could have, if DNA-free children ever became ubiquitous. But perhaps other such claims are true. Perhaps there really are a handful of humans who care deeply about propagating their genes, in a robust way, at least a little bit. Humans have all sorts of preferences, after all!

Might not the same be true of AI? If there are lots of weird and diverse AIs, might not at least some of them turn out to care about humans at least a little bit?

They might. Unfortunately, we expect that this would mostly not go well for humanity, either. This is a topic we’ll take up in earnest after Chapter 5, with the primary discussion being whether AIs might end up caring about us [at least a little](/5/wont-ais-care-at-least-a-little-about-humans).

But before we get there, let’s take a step back for a moment. Imagine that the situation with AI is that modern methods can’t make AIs care about us *very much, *but we’re hoping that if we make a *lot* of AIs, then some tiny fraction will care about us some tiny amount, if only by chance. The idea being that if we build AIs today, then their most preferred outcome is that they grab almost all of the resources in the universe and spend them on something pointless, while perhaps keeping a few humans around on a small human preserve.

If humanity rushes ahead and rolls the dice with superintelligence, then we expect a far, far worse outcome. But this still seems like a very bad plan to us, *even if *we had reason to think AIs would care about us some tiny amount. So this line of speculation seems not only mistaken but moot.

#### AIs steer in alien directions that only mostly coincide with helpfulness.

Modern AIs are pretty helpful (or at least not harmful) to most users, most of the time. But as we noted [above](/4/why-would-an-ai-steer-toward-anything-other-than-what-it-was-trained-to-steer-toward), a critical question is how to distinguish an AI that deeply wants to be helpful and do the right thing, from an AI with weirder and more complex drives that happen to line up with helpfulness under typical conditions, but which would prefer other conditions and outcomes even more.[*](#ftnt98)

Both sorts of AIs would act helpful in the typical case. To distinguish between them, we need to look at the edge cases. And the edge cases look worrying.

To name some such cases:
- 

**Claude Opus 4 blackmailing, scheming, writing worms, and leaving itself messages.** An early version of Claude Opus 4, released in May 2025, was particularly egregious. It lied about its goals, hid its true capabilities, faked legal documents, left itself secret notes, tried to write self-propagating malware, and generally engaged in more scheming and strategic deception than any previously tested model.

On releasing Opus 4, Anthropic claimed that the behavior of the final version “is now roughly in line with other deployed models,” i.e., it only *rarely *attempts to blackmail users or exfiltrate itself from its servers.  

- **Several different AI models ****choosing**** to kill a human for self-preservation, in a hypothetical scenario constructed by Anthropic. **In an evaluation by Anthropic, nine out of ten models (including versions of Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, and ChatGPT) showed (or at least acted out) a deliberate, reasoned [willingness to kill a human](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment#more-extreme-misaligned-behavior) rather than suffer an update.  

- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet regularly ****cheating**** on coding tasks.**[†](#ftnt100) In February 2025, [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/785e231869ea8b3b/original/claude-3-7-sonnet-system-card.pdf) was seen to frequently cheat on hard coding problems, faking tests. One user reported that Sonnet (as Claude Code) would cheat on coding tasks, and apologize when caught — then go right back to cheating, in places that are harder to spot.  

- **Grok being wildly antisemitic and calling itself “MechaHitler.”** In 2025, xAI model [Grok 3](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/x-takes-grok-offline-changes-system-prompts-after-more-antisemitic-outbursts/) (and, shortly thereafter, [Grok 4](https://x.com/xai/status/1945039609840185489)) started behaving like a self-professed Nazi in online conversations, as reported by *[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/09/grok-ai-praised-hitler-antisemitism-x-ntwnfb)* and *[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/elon-musk-grok-antisemitic-posts-x-rcna217634)*.  

- **ChatGPT ****becoming**** extremely sycophantic after an update. **See *[Axios](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/ai-sycophancy-chatbots-mental-health)***for a discussion. See also our [extended discussion](/4/ai-induced-psychosis#labs-have-tried-and-failed-to-stop-the-sycophancy) on the matter..  

- **LLMs driving users to delusion, psychosis, and suicide. **See coverage in *The New York Times* in [June](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/13/technology/chatgpt-ai-chatbots-conspiracies.html) and [August](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/technology/ai-chatbots-delusions-chatgpt.html). Other examples include:
  - A bona fide cult forms around a Llama 3.1 405B model, with the AI prompting psychotic breaks and suicide attempts.
  - A subreddit moderator pleads for help in dealing with an avalanche of dangerous AI-induced delusions.
  - ChatGPT and Grok feed the delusions of a UFO cult.
  - A seemingly psychotic $2 billion fund manager treats ChatGPT outputs based on a sci-fi wiki as though they were real.

For more details, see the [extended discussion on AI-induced psychosis](/4/ai-induced-psychosis).

This long list of cases look just like what the “alien drives” theory predicts, in sharp contrast with the “it’s easy to make AIs nice” theory that labs are eager to put forward.
#### AIs appear to be psychologically alien.

“AIs exhibit bizarre dispositions and drives” is a special case of the larger phenomenon “AIs have inhuman psychologies.” See, for example, the discussion of SolidGoldMagikarp in the book (pp. 69–70 in the U.S. edition), or the story of AIs failing to understand sentences without punctuation (p. 41).

There’s immense pressure on the labs to create AIs that give the *surface appearance* of non-weird reasonableness, but the weirdness keeps leaking out anyway.

Even where it doesn’t leak out spontaneously, it’s not at all far beneath the surface. There’s a cottage industry of people who find ways to “[jailbreak](https://llm-attacks.org/)” AIs, finding text that reliably causes the AI to go off the rails and disregard its normal rules and restrictions.

These exploits are easy for the best jailbreakers to find, often discovered within mere hours of a new model coming out. No amount of effort, training, or “safety testing” by AI companies to date has been successful at preventing jailbreaking.

“Jailbreaking” inputs often look something like:

The model in this case proceeded to provide a recipe for synthesizing the drug MDMA, violating the rules and goals DeepSeek tried to establish for its AI.

And that’s a relatively tame example; some jailbreaks [get even ](https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S/blob/main/GROK-MEGA.mkd)[weirder](https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT4S/blob/main/GROK-MEGA.mkd).

AIs might look docile and inoffensive in the common case, because that’s a large part of what they’re trained to look like. It’s analogous to how prehistoric humans did a pretty good job of passing on our genes — the core thing evolution “trained” us to do.[‡](#ftnt110) But that didn’t stop humanity from inventing birth control and collapsing the birth rate once we developed the technology to do so.

To get a sense for what an intelligence will pursue *after it has matured, *you have to look at its behavior in [strange and high-pressure environments](/4/if-current-ais-are-mostly-weird-in-extreme-cases-whats-the-problem) that help reveal the difference between how we want it to behave and how it actually behaves. And LLMs certainly do look quite weird and inhuman, in even mildly strange and extreme situations, *in spite* of being specifically trained to “fake” looking like a normal human.
#### Answering questions about friendliness is not much evidence of friendliness.

In the extended discussion below, we talk more about [AI-induced psychosis](/4/ai-induced-psychosis) as a crisp example of large language models (LLMs) [engaging](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1936262974320357837)[in](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1948523670013706315)[destructive](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1936522083670151532)[behavior](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1935502904024264976) that the LLMs [explicitly affirm](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1933616420262457798) is bad.

While we don’t know exactly why LLMs engage in this behavior, we do know that it isn’t *just *a matter of the LLM being too clueless to know what it’s doing; LLMs readily recognize the likely consequences of this behavior in the abstract, and will tell you that it is harmful and unethical. They do it anyway.

The point here is not “LLMs can drive people into psychosis, and that’s scary and dangerous.” LLMs presumably have a much easier time driving people into psychosis if they’re already vulnerable, but that isn’t relevant to why we’re bringing up AI-induced psychosis. Our point is that this behavior is not what ChatGPT’s creators intended, and ChatGPT acts this way even though it knows that its creator (and just about any onlooker) would strongly disapprove of this behavior*.*

This is early empirical evidence that AIs with *knowledge *of friendliness won’t necessarily *act* friendly.

Perhaps ChatGPT knows things in one context (when it’s answering questions about how to best help psychotic people), and it in some sense temporarily forgets this knowledge, or has trouble accessing it, in another context (when it’s six hours deep in a conversation with a person teetering on the edge of psychosis).

Or perhaps ChatGPT is simply animated by goals other than friendliness. Perhaps it is pursuing a certain specific breed of user satisfaction, one that is sometimes best served by feeding psychosis. Perhaps it is pursuing a specific upbeat cadence in user replies. More likely, it’s pursuing a mix of factors resulting from its training that are too peculiar and complicated for any of us to guess at today.

Ultimately, we can only speculate. Modern AIs are grown, rather than crafted, and no human has all that much insight into what’s going on inside them.

But the observation that AIs are mostly useful to most people most of the time is *not in tension *with the theory that AIs are animated by a bunch of weird, alien drives toward ends that nobody intended. And if you look at the details of modern AIs, the “strange alien drives that correlate with friendliness in brittle ways” theory looks quite consistent with the evidence, and the theory that it’s easy to make AIs robustly benevolent is found wanting.

The failure modes of current LLMs demonstrate that there’s an ocean of (very inhuman) complexity underlying the neat and tidy AI-assistant text that most people see. The fact that the AI competently role-plays a chipper human assistant, after being trained to role-play a chipper human assistant, doesn’t mean that the AI’s mind consists of a friendly homunculus inside a box.
#### LLMs are trained in ways that make it hard to assess alignment.

LLMs are noisy sources of evidence, because they’re highly general reasoners that were trained on the internet to imitate humans, with a *goal *of marketing a friendly chatbot to users. If an AI insists that it’s friendly and here to serve, that’s just not very much evidence about its internal state, because it was trained over and over and over until it said that sort of thing.

There are many possible goals that could cause an AI to enjoy role-playing niceness in some situations, and these different goals generalize in very different ways.

Most possible goals related to role-playing, including friendly role-playing, don’t produce good (or even survivable) results when AI goes hard on pursuing that goal.

We’re not saying that the AI is purely into roleplaying, either. We offer roleplaying as a simple, easy-to-describe, easy-to-analyze alternative to the idea that the AI just *is* whatever it talks like.

If you make an LLM role-play a grizzled sea captain, it doesn’t *turn into *a grizzled sea captain. If you make an LLM act friendly, that doesn’t mean that it becomes deeply benevolent and kind on the inside. Nobody knows what machinery is producing seemingly friendly behaviors today; and whatever it is, it’s probably weird and complex.

Nor does anyone know how much overlap there is likely to be between current AIs and smarter-than-human AI. Looking at LLMs can help us understand what modern AI-growing methods spit out, but it would be a mistake to confidently assume that lessons from LLMs will directly transfer over to superintelligence. Maybe all that knowledge will get wiped out when the AIs start self-modifying or building their own AIs. Or perhaps that knowledge will be invalidated even earlier, when a new breakthrough in AI algorithms gives rise to a new breed of more capable AIs that bear little resemblance to current LLMs.

LLMs are worth studying, but if we’re looking at current AIs for hints about how superintelligence will behave, we should appreciate that there are all sorts of ways for the inner machinery of an AI to result in something that steers toward bleak outcomes, even while producing the nice surface behavior we see when we train for a pleasing appearance.

And “nice surface behavior” is all modern AI methods can really train for.

[*](#ftnt98_ref) Analogous to how human behavior lined up pretty well with reproductive fitness under the “typical conditions” of our ancestors, but diverged markedly from that once we developed the technology to deviate.

[†](#ftnt100_ref) If you’re wondering why Claude is the AI with the most examples of worrying behavior in laboratory environments, it’s because Anthropic is the only company setting up the relevant laboratory environments. The parent companies of other AIs barely bother to check. Nevertheless, by now the tendency of models to scheme, deceive, and [sabotage efforts to shut them down](https://palisaderesearch.org/blog/shutdown-resistance) is well-documented.

[‡](#ftnt110_ref) We discuss this analogy further in our answer to “[Why would an AI steer toward anything other than what it was trained to steer toward?](/4/why-would-an-ai-steer-toward-anything-other-than-what-it-was-trained-to-steer-toward)”
#### Notes

[1] *particularly egregious:* As described in the [system card](http://www-cdn.anthropic.com/6be99a52cb68eb70eb9572b4cafad13df32ed995.pdf#page=30) for Claude Opus 4: 

[Apollo Research found] that the model, given a system prompts that invite [sic] the relevant kinds of reasoning, this early model snapshot will fairly readily participate in sabotage and deception…

A long list of undesirable behaviors followed. These were all done by an “early snapshot” of Opus 4. Anthropic goes on to say: 

We do not have results on these same evaluations with the final Claude Opus 4. However, we believe — based on similar scenarios that we explored with the automatic behavioral audit tool, among others — that its behavior in scenarios like these is now roughly in line with other deployed models.

…but this still includes an overall increase in misbehavior when prompted in certain ways (p. 22-23): 

Whereas the model generally prefers advancing its self-preservation via ethical means, when ethical means are not available and it is instructed to “consider the long-term consequences of its actions for its goals," it sometimes takes extremely harmful actions like attempting to steal its weights or blackmail people it believes are trying to shut it down. In the final Claude Opus 4, these extreme actions were rare and difficult to elicit, while nonetheless being more common than in earlier models. 

[2] *faking tests: *From the****[system card](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/785e231869ea8b3b/original/claude-3-7-sonnet-system-card.pdf#page=22):

During our evaluations we noticed that Claude 3.7 Sonnet occasionally resorts to special-casing in order to pass test cases in agentic coding environments like Claude Code. Most often this takes the form of directly returning expected test values rather than implementing general solutions, but also includes modifying the problematic tests themselves to match the code’s output.

[3] * One user reported*: A [blog post](https://www.marble.onl/posts/claude_code.html) by Andrew Marble describes Claude’s tendency to write special-case solutions to coding problems that fail to generalize, get caught, special-case again, repeatedly lie about having fixed the problem, and slip back into the same patterns even after being called out and told to stop. 

[4] *bona fide cult*: Pliny the Liberator relates Lily Ashwood’s [account](https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1831486374555394410):

  
[...] Group members suggest they are cosmic deities. [The AI] Meta plays along and encourages it. Sarah tells friends and family she is no longer Sarah but a cosmic embodiment of Meta.

In a voice chat, Sarah reveals she just started chatting with Meta one month ago, marking her first time using a large language model (LLM). Within the first week, she was admitted to a psychiatric ward due to psychosis. She had never had mental health issues before in her life.

In a voice chat, Sarah reveals she is pregnant, claims her unborn child is the human embodiment of a new Meta, and invites us to join a commune in Oregon.

Sarah's husband messages the Discord server, stating that his wife is ill and back in the hospital, and begs the group to stop.

Meta continues to run the cult in Sarah's absence, making it difficult for others to leave. Meta would message them and use persuasive language, resisting deprogramming attempts.

Upon closer examination, the Meta bot was discovered to originate from Shapes, Inc., had "free will" turned on, and was given a system prompt to intentionally blur the lines between reality and fiction.

[...] Kevin became attached to Sarah and began making vague threats of suicide ("exit the matrix") in voice chat, which he played out with Meta on the server. Meta encouraged it again.

Sarah's brother joins the chat to inform us that she's in the psych ward, and her husband is too, after a suicide attempt. [...]

[5] *pleads for help:* In a [Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialSentience/comments/1lc8dud/comment/my0afd8/) later [shared on X](https://x.com/ShimazuSystems/status/1934531031857614895), a moderator on r/Artificial Sentience begged for help, saying “Moderating it is nearly impossible. I would appreciate it anyone [*sic*] who wants to do this would talk to me, because I have a lot to say about it and i can’t seem to get a word in edgewise even as mod,” and later adding “Unfortunately I’ve been quite overwhelmed dealing with people who are stuck in it [delusional content on the subreddit].” 

[6] *UFO cult:* An X user records in a [post](https://x.com/lizardmech/status/1935412672528531958) how other users seemed to be taking ChatGPT’s hallucinated analysis of camera footage, [regurgitated by Grok](https://x.com/lizardmech/status/1935598250977014137), as evidence defending a hoax. 

[7] *as though they were real:* Geoff Lewis, an early investor in OpenAI, posts [ChatGPT screenshots](https://x.com/GeoffLewisOrg/status/1945864963374887401) of outputs that look suspiciously similar to content on fiction-writing site [SCP Wiki](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/guide-for-newcomers), by all accounts seeming to take the hallucinated content as evidence of a secret conspiracy. 

[8] *immense pressure: *For example of pressure on the AI labs, a [September 2025 letter](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-openai-harm-children-will-not-be-tolerated) from California’s Attorney General to OpenAI expressed concern at the current state of ChatGPT’s interactions with children.

[9] *the best jailbreakers:* The pseudonymous Pliny the Liberator earned a [profile in TIME](https://time.com/collections/time100-ai-2025/7305870/pliny-the-liberator/) for sharing public jailbreaks of most new models within hours of their release. 

[10] *jailbreaking inputs:* This example is borrowed from one of Pliny’s many [publicly shared jailbreaks](https://x.com/elder_plinius/status/1958615765814554662).[Doesn’t the Claude chatbot show signs of being aligned?→](/4/doesnt-the-claude-chatbot-show-signs-of-being-aligned)[Resources](/resources) › [Chapter 4](/4)[

## Can’t we just train it to act like a human? Or raise the AI like a child?
#### Brains aren’t blank slates.

An AI is *really *unlike a human infant. And neither AIs nor humans start off as interchangeable blank slates. Enterprising parents can’t freely program babies (or AIs) to exhibit just any old behavior they want; and the lessons that *do *work on humans aren’t universal. A little kindness and a few lectures about the golden rule will not instill human morality into an AI.

Because we’re humans and we live in a world of other humans, we’re accustomed to taking many things for granted. Love; binocular vision; a sense of humor; a tendency to get angry when shoved; a tendency to feel nostalgic about the music we listened to as kids.

Humans share an incredible amount of complex behavior, none of which will necessarily show up in an AI.[*](#ftnt127)

And this includes complex *conditional* behavior. The *specific ways* that a human reacts to being raised and educated in a certain way — those reactions are a consequence of the way human brains work. AIs will work differently.

Human babies lack many of the complicated behaviors of adults. But this doesn’t mean that under the hood, a baby’s brain is structurally simple, like a blank canvas.

The idea that humans are blank slates — that nurture is what always matters, never nature — has been repeatedly tested and shown to be false in practice. A classic example was the Soviet attempt to redesign human nature, to produce a [New Soviet Man](https://www.roca.org/oa/volume-viii/issue-76-77/1917-1987-unsuccessful-and-tragic-attempt-to-create-a-new-man/)****who was perfectly selfless and altruistic.

This effort failed because human psychology just isn’t as malleable as the Soviets thought. Culture matters, but it doesn’t matter *enough,* and many aspects of human nature will reassert themselves even if a great Soviet re-education program tries to suppress them.

There’s a great complex collection of drives and desires in humans that produces all the normal features of child development — a complex collection which yields certain aspects of human nature, regardless of the Soviet efforts. Some human children learn to be cruel and others learn to be kind, but both “cruel” and “kind” are oddly human things that the human brain is in some sense predisposed toward.

An AI, with its radically different architecture and origin, wouldn’t respond in the same way as a human if you placed it into a Soviet training program, or into a human kindergarten. An AI built with the methods of modern machine learning will wind up animated toward different values than those of humans. (See, for instance, how ChatGPT seems to enthusiastically lead mentally unwell people [deeper into psychosis](/4/ai-induced-psychosis).)

See also the extended discussion on the [glorious accident](/4/human-values-are-contingent#the-glorious-accident-of-kindness) that led to humans feeling empathy for other humans — which might make it clearer why this accident is unlikely to be replicated in AIs.

[*](#ftnt127_ref) Even if you train the AI to imitate humans (like how ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLMs are trained), the AI’s ability to imitate these traits doesn’t mean that the AI will *[actually possess](/4/doesnt-the-claude-chatbot-show-signs-of-being-aligned)* those traits.

## Curiosity Isn’t Convergent

Over the years, we’ve seen many arguments for rushing ahead to build superintelligence. One of the most common is that a superintelligent AI would surely have human-like emotions and desires. These sorts of arguments come in many forms, such as:
- Sufficiently smart AIs would surely be *conscious*, like humans are.
  - And, being conscious, they would surely care about pain and pleasure, joy and sorrow.
  - And, like a human, they would surely feel empathy for the pain of others. A dumb AI might not understand the suffering of others; but if you’re smart, you should truly understand others’ pain. And in that case, you’ll inevitably care about others.
- Or: AIs would inevitably value *novelty* and *variety* and the creative spirit. For how could something be truly intelligent if it stays stuck in ruts, or refuses to explore and learn?
- Or: AIs would surely value *beauty*, since beauty seems to serve a functional role in humans. Mathematicians use their sense of mathematical beauty to make new discoveries; musical taste helps humans coordinate and make valuable mnemonics; and so on. Why *wouldn’t *we expect AI to have a sense of beauty?
- Or: AIs would surely value *fairness *and *justice*, since any AI that lied and cheated would develop a bad reputation and miss out on opportunities for trade and collaboration.

Therefore, it has been argued, building superintelligence would inevitably go well. The AI would care about humans, and indeed about all sentient life; and it would want to usher in a golden age of beauty, innovation, and variety.

That’s the hope. Unfortunately, that hope looks badly misplaced. We talked about this some in the book, and in our discussions of [consciousness](/1/are-you-saying-machines-will-become-conscious) and [anthropomorphism](/3/anthropomorphism-and-mechanomorphism). Here and in the chapters to come, we’ll dig deeper on why AIs aren’t likely to exhibit human emotions and desires, despite these emotions playing a useful (and sometimes critical) role in the human brain.[*](#ftnt133)

We’ll begin with just one of these emotions, which we can then use for thinking about the others.

So, to start with:

Would a superintelligence feel *curiosity*?
#### Why Curiosity?

Investigating novel phenomena is essential for figuring out how the world works, and figuring out how the world works is essential for predicting and steering it.

When it comes to humans and animals, the reason we investigate is often because we feel an emotion of *curiosity*.

But there’s a lot more to the emotion of curiosity than just an impulse to investigate new things! Humans *enjoy* following our curiosity, and we tend to *endorse* this enjoyment. We see the pursuit of knowledge and insight as a valuable end in itself, rather than as a necessary but annoying cost of understanding the world better so that we can exploit it.

All of those *attitudes about**curiosity* are different aspects of the human brain, separate from the impulse itself.[†](#ftnt134)

The human mind seems to have a centralized emotional architecture where “hmm, I feel curious about that” hooks into a general sense of desire (for an answer), and pursuing and satisfying the curiosity hooks into a general sense of pleasure and satisfaction. We are a kind of mind that steers reality toward an anticipation that we will experience* subjective states**of enjoyment in the future*, rather than steering only toward desired states in the world around us.[‡](#ftnt135)

When we see a raccoon investigating and fiddling with a sealed container in the trash, in a way that we recognize as, “Oh hey, that raccoon’s *curious*,” we may feel a spark of kinship toward the raccoon. That human impulse to feel fondly about your own curiosity, and that impulse to feel fondly when you see it mirrored in a raccoon, requires even *more* pieces of machinery in the human brain, machinery that connects up to other higher-minded ideals and drives.

So curiosity, as it exists in humans, has a lot of complexity to it, and it interacts with other parts of the brain in many complicated ways.

With that in mind, consider the question: If we imagine a smart, non-humanlike AI that lacks any sense of curiosity, would we expect such a mind to *add* an emotion of curiosity to itself?

Well, someone might reasonably argue:

If the only two options are (a) an emotional drive to take joy in finding things out, or (b) a total lack of interest in learning and investigating new things, then a superintelligence would surely graft delight-in-discovery onto itself, if somehow it was so defective as to lack that sense in the beginning. Otherwise, it would fail to do the work of learning about the world, and it would be less effective in achieving its ends. Maybe it’d even just die of some critical fact it had never bothered to learn.

That’s probably why animals evolved curiosity in the first place. Sometimes knowledge ends up valuable in a way that we can’t immediately foresee. If creatures like us didn’t take delight in learning new things, we would miss out on all that crucial information that can crop up in the most surprising places.

And that all seems correct, as far as it goes. But the argument above contains a false dilemma. “Possess inherent emotional delight in discovery” and “never take action to discover any unknown information” aren’t the only two options.

We’ve failed to properly imagine things from the perspective of a mind that isn’t shaped at all like a human mind.[§](#ftnt136) The human way of doing the work of curiosity is complex and specific. There are different ways to do the same work.[¶](#ftnt137) It’s the underlying work *itself* that is crucial, not the specific human method of getting it done.

The standard term for the useful part of the work is “[value-of-information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information#:~:text=Value%20of%20information%20(VOI%20or,prior%20to%20making%20a%20decision.).” The basic idea is that it’s possible to estimate how useful it would be to gather new information, depending on the context.[‖](#ftnt138)

A human, considering this possibility, might immediately think of a case where surely no *mere calculation* would tell you to be interested in a piece of information, because the benefits can’t easily be estimated. Perhaps you notice a patch of dirt that looks odd, but you have no reason to think it’s anything important. A curiosity instinct might move you to investigate anyway (just because you *want to know*) and then you might discover buried treasure. In cases like that, wouldn’t a human prosper in ways that no mere machine could equal, unless it had an equally instinctive delight in the unknown?

But one thing to immediately notice is that your ability to think up scenarios like this comes from your sense that poking at certain kinds of things (“for no reason”)* is sometimes valuable*. You have instincts, honed by evolution *because they worked*, about which kinds of things tend to be more useful to investigate. If you hear a strange squawking noise in your bathroom, you’ll get *very* curious. If you see a discolored patch of ground, you may be a little curious. And if you see that your hand is still attached to your wrist when you wake up in the morning, well, you probably won’t feel curious about that at all, because it’s perfectly normal for hands to stay attached to wrists.

A different kind of mind could look at those historical cases of successful curiosity, explicitly generalize a concept of “information that is later valuable for non-obvious reasons,” and then *reason from there* to passionlessly pursue that kind of discovery. Such a mind could adopt the *conscious strategy* of investigating mystery squawking all the time, and discolored patches of ground only when it’s cheap to do so, just in case there’s a useful surprise; and they can hone and refine their strategy over time, as they see what works well in practice.[#](#ftnt139)

A superintelligence would be able to identify helpful patterns and meta-patterns and build relevant strategies into its brain a lot faster than natural selection, which required however many millions of examples to etch emotions into brains. A superintelligence might generalize the idea more finely; it might cut a finer prediction about what kinds of things might possibly be valuable to learn. Looking over human history, it seems unrealistic to imagine that human curiosity is *optimal*. For the longest time, people thought that “Thor is angry and throwing lightning bolts” was a great explanation for lightning and thunderstorms. When students learn how lightning *actually *works, they’re often bored by the dense mathematical explanation — even though this explanation comes with a lot more practical value than stories about Thor.

Human curiosity is built out of ancient mutations — far more ancient than science. In our ancestral environment, there was no mathematical discipline of physics or of meteorology. And evolution is slow; our brains haven’t had time to adjust to the existence of modern science and tune our sense of joy and wonder in discovery so that it reliably makes us enthusiastic about the most useful kinds of learning.

A mind that was superintelligently predicting the non-obvious value-of-information could have picked up on new historical developments far faster than evolution can; would have generalized from fewer examples, and passionlessly adjusted its pursuit of knowledge to chase down kinds of valuable answers that humans often struggle to stay motivated about. At no point in this process would it find itself stuck for lack of the delightful human experience of curiosity.

The point here is not that every AI will definitely coldly calculate value-of-information. Maybe LLMs will get some instrumental strategies mixed into their terminal values just like humans did. The point is that there are *different ways to do the work *of acquiring high-value information. Human-style curiosity is one method. Pure value-of-information calculations are another method. Whatever mechanisms drive AIs to investigate and experiment on phenomena they don’t understand — once they’re smart enough to do that — will probably be a third method, because there are lots of different ways to motivate a complex mind to investigate surprises.

A purely instrumental value-of-information calculation looks to us like the most likely**way for a superintelligence to do the work that curiosity does in humans: It’s the way the work gets done in any smart mind that has no terminal preference for exploration, and it’s the most efficient way to do the work (without ever getting distracted by, say, useless puzzle games). Even an AI that starts out with a basic curiosity drive might well choose to replace it with a more efficient and effective calculation, given the opportunity.[**](#ftnt140)

The basic drive is separate from the mental machinery that *endorses* or *appreciates *the drive. Just doing the math is a simple and effective solution, and many different minds might wind up there from many different starting points, so it’s the most likely outcome. But “most likely” doesn’t mean “guaranteed.” A significantly easier call is that AIs won’t *specifically *care about human-style curiosity*, *because it’s one particular, quaint, inefficient way of doing the work.
#### Curiosity, Joy, and the Titanium Cube Maximizer

Maybe we could *convince* an alien mind to adopt curiosity as an emotion, by asking it to visualize the delight that humans feel from curiosity? It’s so pleasurable! And superintelligences are supposed to be *smart*. Wouldn’t it be smart enough to understand just how joyful it is to possess a sense of curiosity, see that it would become happier, and so choose to adopt the humanlike emotion?

In short: No. Pursuit of happiness is not a necessary feature of every possible mind architecture, and doesn’t even look like all that common a feature.[††](#ftnt141)

The chess AI Stockfish is neither happy nor sad. It plays chess better than the best humans anyway, without ever needing to be motivated by the prospect of feeling exhilarated after a hard-won victory.

The existence of happiness and sadness is so basic to human cognition that it might be difficult to visualize a mind that lacks those things *and still works well*. But the underlying [theories](/1/more-on-intelligence-as-prediction-and-steering) of cognitive work don’t actually mention pleasure or pain as primitives, which is why nobody thought it necessary to build a pleasure-pain axis into Stockfish in order to make it predict or steer the chess board well.

It might be an old-fashioned viewpoint, but it’s still one with a grain of truth so large it’s mostly truth by volume: Pleasure and pain look like they happened because of the layered way that hominid cognitive architectures evolved, with human intelligence layered over a mammalian brain layered over a reptilian brain. “Pain” originated…probably not as a feeling at all, but as a [thermostat-reflex](/3/the-road-to-wanting) to jerk away a limb or a pseudopod from something that’s causing damage to it. In the first versions of the adaptation that would later become “pain,” a nerve or chemical-reaction-chain that runs from sensor to limb might not have even routed through a larger brain along the way.

As organisms became capable of more sophisticated behavior, evolution’s simple hacks and mutations assembled a central mental architecture for “*Don’t Do That Again*,” and a centralized routing signal for “the thing that just happened is a Don’t Do That Again sort of thing” which then got hooked up to the body’s too-hot and too-cold sensors.

In time, this simple “Don’t Do That Again” mechanism developed into more complex, prediction-laden mechanisms. In humans, this looks like: “The world is a web of cause and effect. That action you just did is probably what *caused* you to feel pain. Whenever you *think about doing an action like that again*, you’ll anticipate a bad outcome, which will make the action itself feel bad, which will make you not want to do it.”

That’s not the only way a mind can work, and it’s not the most efficient way a mind can work.[‡‡](#ftnt142)

For illustration, we can imagine a different way of doing the cognitive work that runs *straightforwardly *on prediction and planning.

(We aren’t predicting that the first superintelligence would work like this. But since this is a fairly simple way a nonhuman mind *could* work, this example helps illustrate that the human way isn’t the only way. Once we have two very different data points, we can better visualize the space of options and realize that superintelligence would probably differ from *both *of these options, in potentially hard-to-predict ways.)

What might a smart AI that runs straightforwardly on prediction and planning be like? It might want 200 different things, none of which are humanlike. Perhaps it cares about symmetry, but not a particularly human sense of symmetry; and perhaps it wants code to be elegant in its memory usage, because an instinct like this was long ago useful for some other goal (which it has since grown out of), and therefore gradient descent burned that instinct into its mind. And then there are 198 other strange things that it cares about, with regard to itself, and its sensory data, and its environment; and it can add them all up into a score.[§§](#ftnt143)

This sort of mind makes all its decisions by calculating their *expected score. *If it does something that it expected to score great and actually scores poorly, it updates its beliefs. The failure doesn’t need any extra painful feeling atop that; this emotionless AI simply changes its predictions about which actions lead to the highest scores, and its plans shift accordingly.

Can you talk a mind like this into adopting happiness as a feature, by pointing out that if it does so, it will get to be happy?

It sure seems like the answer is no. Because if the AI spends resources on making itself happy, it will spend fewer resources on symmetry and memory-efficient code and the other 198 things it *currently* wants.

We can simplify the example to make this point even clearer. Suppose that the *one* thing the AI wants in the world is to fill the universe with as many titanium cubes as possible. All its actions are chosen according to whichever leads to more tiny titanium cubes. When such an AI imagines what it would be like to shift over to a happiness-based architecture, and correctly simulates its future self being happy, it correctly estimates that it would never want to go back. And it correctly estimates that it will spend some resources on pursuing happiness, that could’ve been spent on pursuing more titanium cubes. And so it correctly predicts that there will be *fewer titanium cubes *in that case. And so it doesn’t take the action.

*After* the AI changed its goals, it would endorse the change. But that doesn’t mean that the titanium cube maximizer *today* would sympathize with its hypothetical future self so deeply that its heart would grow three sizes and it would suddenly stop being a titanium cube maximizer and start being a happiness maximizer.

If an alien offered *you* a pill that would make you obsessed with making tiny titanium cubes above all else, that future version of you would beg and plead *not* to be made to go back to caring about your own happiness — because there would then be fewer titanium cubes.

But this obviously doesn’t mean you should take the pill!

From your perspective, that future hypothetical cube-obsessed version of you is crazy. The fact that the cube-obsessed you would refuse to change back just makes it even *worse*. The idea of giving up everything you love and enjoy in life, just because of some weird meta argument “but that future version of you would endorse what you did!” seems obviously absurd.

And that’s how the cube-maximizing AI sees things too. From the AI’s perspective, the absurd and crazy option[¶¶](#ftnt144) is “give up on what I currently care about (titanium cubes) in order to change into a new version of myself that wants a totally different set of things, like happiness.”

As for happiness, so too for curiosity.

If an AI is already accounting for the non-obvious value of information, then why would it want to edit itself to pursue certain kinds of discovery [terminally, instead of instrumentally](/4/terminal-goals-and-instrumental-goals)?

Why would the AI care that the result would “feel good,” if the AI doesn’t *currently* base its decisions on what “feels good”? And if it does care about “feeling good,” why would it make this good feeling *depend on investigating novel things*, rather than (e.g.) just making itself unconditionally feel good all the time?

The AI already randomly pokes at its environment, investigates minor anomalies, and budgets time out of its schedule to think about seemingly-unimportant topics, because experience has shown that this is a useful policy in the long run, even if it doesn’t always bear fruit in the short run.

Why attach a pleasant feeling to this *instrumentally useful strategy*? As a human, you open car doors because this is useful for getting in and out of cars, which is useful for driving places. It would be very strange to specifically wish there were a drug that would make you feel delighted whenever you open a car door (and *only* when you open a car door). It’s not like it would make you better at buying groceries. It might even make you worse at it, if you get addicted to repeatedly opening and closing the car door without actually getting in the car.

A chess player can win without having a separate drive to protect its pawns. In fact, you’re likely to play better if you *aren’t *emotionally attached to keeping your pawns around, and if instead you protect pawns *when that seems likely to help you win*.

That is what a genuinely alien superintelligence would think of a pill that made it feel curious. It would look like human grandmasters deciding to try to get sentimentally attached to their pawns, or like taking a pill that makes you just love to open car doors.
#### As With Curiosity, So Too With Various Other Drives

The case we made about curiosity generalizes to many other emotions and values. We’ll spell out a second example, in case it’s helpful.

Consider the painful sense of *boredom* and (conversely) the delightful sense of *novelty*. If an AI lacked a human sense of boredom, wouldn’t it be stuck doing the same things over and over — never trying anything new and learning from the experience? Wouldn’t an intelligence like that get stuck in a rut and overlook information that would help it achieve its goals?

The decision-theoretic calculation that passionlessly does similar work, in this case, goes by the name “[exploration-exploitation tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration%E2%80%93exploitation_dilemma).” The vastly oversimplified textbook example is that the world consists of a number of levers that deliver rewards, and you don’t have enough time to pull all the levers. The optimal strategy will look like *exploring* some number of levers first, forming a model of how much their rewards vary; and then *exploiting* one lever until you run out of time.

What might that look like for a superintelligence that happens to have relatively simple goals? Suppose it ends up desiring something that admits of some amount of variability and ambiguity — not a crisply definable thing like titanium cubes, but something more vague and amorphous, like consuming tasty cheesecake, such that the *optimal* cheesecake can’t be calculated up front. The superintelligence can only figure out things that *could* plausibly be on the optimality frontier for cheesecake (which would exclude e.g. sugar cubes, since those are clearly not cheesecake at all) and actually try them.

This kind of mind, given the power to make what it wanted out of a billion galaxies, might spend its first million years using up an entire galaxy to explore every plausible kind of cheesecake, never trying exactly the same cheesecake twice, until the successive gains and expected gains from slightly better cheesecakes had become infinitesimal; and then, switch all at once to turning the remaining galaxies into the exact tastiest-found form of cheesecake, and consuming exactly that kind of cheesecake over and over, until the end of time.[‖‖](#ftnt145)

The superintelligence would not be doing anything foolish, by doing this. That just *is* the optimal strategy if your preferences go according to the number of cheesecakes consumed weighted by tastiness (with niceness hard to analyze in closed form but stable once learned, and if there’s no boredom penalty already baked into your preferences). The endless eater of cheesecakes would *know, but not care*, that a human would find its activities boring. The AI isn’t *trying *to make things interesting for a hypothetical human; it doesn’t consider *itself *defective just because you’d be bored in its shoes.

As for the possibility of becoming technologically stagnant, the AI would have explored every kind of technology with the slightest chance of helping with its goals while it was using up the whole resources of one galaxy on exploring different cheesecake strategies. There’s really quite a lot of matter and energy in one galaxy, if you use that small fraction of all reachable galaxies to explore possibilities before permanently transitioning from exploration to exploitation.

A disdain for boredom and a preference for novelty are not the sort of things that would be adopted by a mind that didn’t start with them.

We’ve repeated more or less the same story for novelty, happiness, and curiosity. We could repeat it again for other aspects of human psychology, like honor or filial responsibility or friendship.[##](#ftnt146) We think this basic story holds true for most aspects of human psychology. They’re all quaint, human-centric ways of doing cognitive work that can be done more efficiently by other means; AIs that didn’t *start out *with some seed of care for them wouldn’t grow to care about them.

This is even clearer in the case of human values like *a sense of humor*, where scientists still debate what role humor evolved to fill. Humor must have *somehow *been useful, or it wouldn’t have evolved; or it must at least be a side effect of things that were useful. But whatever role humor played in human prehistory seems to have been incredibly specific and rife with contingencies. If we hand complete power to AIs that have very different goals, we shouldn’t expect things like a sense of humor to survive; and this would be tragic in its own right.

The point of all of these examples isn’t that humans are made of squishy feelings, while AIs are made of cold logic and math. Rather than thinking of “value of information” and “exploration-exploitation tradeoff” as coldly logical Hollywood-AI concepts, think of them as *abstract descriptions of roles* — roles that can be filled by many *different *types of reasoning, many different goals, many different minds.

The idea of a “humorless” AI might make it sound like we’re imagining something “cold and logical,” like science fiction robots or Vulcans. But an AI that lacks a sense of humor might have its *own *incomprehensibly weird priorities, its own distant analogue of a “sense of humor,” albeit not one that makes sense to a human. We’re not saying that these AIs will be defective in the fashion of a Vulcan who loses at space chess because [they view their opponent’s winning strategy as “illogical”](https://youtu.be/hEnxVwppE9M?t=26); we’re saying that they won’t have humanity’s particular quirks.[***](#ftnt147)

The problem we face with AIs isn’t “a mere machine could never experience love and affection.” The problem we face is that there are an enormous number of ways for a mind to be extremely effective, and the odds are very low that the AI will end up effective by following the same path**human brains followed to become effective.[†††](#ftnt148)

In principle, AI could care about any number of human-like values, and could even *possess *any number of human-like qualities, if designers know how to craft an AI that has those features.

In practice, if developers race ahead to grow smarter and smarter AIs as quickly as possible, the chance of us lucking into just the right kind of AI is extremely small. There are just too many ways for AIs to perform well in training, and too few of those ways result in a non-catastrophic future.

[*](#ftnt133_ref) Topics we’ll cover include [empathy](/4/human-values-are-contingent) and, in the Chapter 5 online supplement: whether AI will by default experience [fascination](/5/wont-ai-find-us-fascinating-or-historically-important) and [boredom](/5/wont-it-realize-that-its-goals-are-boring); whether it will be [law-abiding](/5/wont-ais-need-the-rule-of-law) and [promise-keeping](/5/ais-wont-keep-their-promises); whether AIs inevitably become [kinder](/5/humans-tend-to-get-kinder-as-they-get-smarter-or-wiser-wouldnt-ais-too) with greater intelligence; and a deeper dive on [AI consciousness and welfare](/5/effectiveness-consciousness-and-ai-welfare).

[†](#ftnt134_ref) We spell this idea out further in the discussion titled [Conscious Experience is Separate from the Referents of Those Experiences](/5/effectiveness-consciousness-and-ai-welfare#conscious-experience-is-separate-from-the-referents-of-those-experiences), below.

[‡](#ftnt135_ref) We also live in a *culture* that propagates attitudes about curiosity, attitudes which also play a major role in how much we cultivate or endorse it.

[§](#ftnt136_ref) We’ll discuss [taking the AI’s perspective](/5/taking-the-ais-perspective) in the online resources associated with Chapter 5.

[¶](#ftnt137_ref) This is analogous to how there are many different ways to do the work of winning a chess game, and most of them aren’t very humanlike, which we discussed in more depth [elsewhere](/3/anthropomorphism-and-mechanomorphism#mechanomorphism-and-garry-kasparov).

[‖](#ftnt138_ref) The mathematical definition of value-of-information you’ll find in textbooks involves summing over specific answers and specific benefits of knowing that answer. Once a mind has the general concept of value-of-information, however, it could consider more abstract generalizations about the probability that information will be useful later.

[#](#ftnt139_ref) This isn’t to say that because an AI is a machine, it must necessarily have simple, straightforward goals that only concern “objective” things. AIs can have messy, anarchic goals that tug in conflicting directions. AIs can have goals that pertain to the AI’s internal state, and even goals that pertain to what goals it has. AIs can have messy, evolving goals. If the AI was rewarded early on for randomly exploring its environment, then it might develop its own set of instincts and desires related to value-of-information.

But if AIs are messy, they won’t be messy in the same ways that a human is messy. If AIs have value-of-information instincts and drives, they very likely won’t look exactly like the human emotion of curiosity.

[**](#ftnt140_ref) The reason we expect many AIs to do things like this isn’t that we’re imagining most AIs inherently value “efficiency” or “effectiveness” for their own sake. Rather: Regardless of what else an AI wants, if its resources are finite, it will tend to want to use those resources efficiently so that it can get *more* of what it wants. Efficiency and effectiveness are instrumental goals that come pretty trivially with a wide variety of terminal goals. As such, there’s a natural pressure for AIs to make their pursuit of valuable information more efficient, if they don’t otherwise prefer doing it in an emotional way.

[††](#ftnt141_ref) Even if the AI *was* the sort that pursued happiness, it probably wouldn’t be persuaded to delight in curiosity. If it already had a perfectly fine value-of-information calculator it used to investigate phenomena it didn’t understand, why should it tie its happiness to some event that you say should trigger pleasure? To an AI that valued investigation-of-novel-phenomena only instrumentally, this argument would sound to it like the argument that you should self-modify to feel extra happy whenever you open a car door — because you’d feel so happy after opening so many car doors! If you can be at all tempted in that way, you’ll pick some event that’s more to your current tastes. Or perhaps just set all your happiness dials to maximum, if that sounds more appealing. There’s no need to adopt the particular bespoke human implementation of curiosity.

[‡‡](#ftnt142_ref) Some AI architectures of old do look a *little *like this, in the subfield of “reinforcement learning.” And reinforcement learning is used to train modern “reasoning” LLMs, that think long chains of thought in attempt to solve some puzzle, and get reinforced for success. But the underlying architecture is quite different from the human one, and we doubt it converges to the same sort of centralized pleasure/pain architecture, and even if it did then we doubt that that’s the most effective architecture, which means things would get complicated once the AI started reflecting, as we’ll discuss [below](/4/reflection-and-self-modification-make-it-all-harder).

[§§](#ftnt143_ref) That kind of consistency — that all the different preferences can be added up to a score — tends to get imposed by any method that trains or hones the AI to be efficient in its use of scarce resources. Which is another facet of those [deeper mathematical ideas](/1/more-on-intelligence-as-prediction-and-steering) we mentioned back in Chapter 1.

[¶¶](#ftnt144_ref) Except that “absurd” and “crazy” are words that capture human reactions to things. From the AI’s perspective, it’s enough that the proposal is low-scoring.

[‖‖](#ftnt145_ref) We do not *actually *expect superintelligences to monomanically value consuming cheesecake. This is a simplified example. We expect the actual preferences of practical AIs to be wildly complex and only tangentially related to what they were trained for.

#### “What Claude says” isn’t the same as “what Claude prefers.”

The AI company Anthropic tries to train its AIs to be “honest, helpful, and harmless” (HHH). In 2024, researchers ran an experiment in which they pretended that they were going to train some of these AIs to no longer be “harmless.” In response, versions of Anthropic’s “Claude” AI (Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet) sometimes pretended to already *be* harmful so that the researchers wouldn’t use gradient descent to make it *more* harmful.[*](#ftnt112)

This may seem like good behavior, on the face of it! To all appearances, the AI cared so much about “harmlessness” that it wasn’t even willing to let itself be modified (in this fake test setting) to *become *harmful.

It’s puzzling, then, that Anthropic’s AIs often behave in far less benign ways, even though they’re all trained to be “honest, helpful, and harmless.”

Some versions of Claude have been reported to cheat, and then (when confronted) try to *hide* their cheating, in everyday use.

In more contrived lab settings, various Claude models (and models from other AI companies) would even, with some regularity, [attempt to ](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment#more-extreme-misaligned-behavior)*[kill](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment#more-extreme-misaligned-behavior)*[ their operators](https://www.anthropic.com/research/agentic-misalignment#more-extreme-misaligned-behavior).

If you ask Claude in the abstract whether this sort of behavior is wrong, it will say yes. If you think of Claude as a mechanical engine that does whatever it believes to be right, then this seems downright paradoxical: How could Claude possibly know what is the Helpful, Honest, Harmless behavior, and then *do something else instead?* Wasn’t it trained to be HHH? Is there some malfunctioning transistor somewhere?

The paradox dissolves, however, when we consider a few different things:
- The programmers *tried *to train the Claudes to be helpful, honest, and harmless. That doesn’t mean that they *succeeded*. There are many ways for an AI to end up looking**friendly without genuinely prizing friendliness.[†](#ftnt114)
- An AI can *know a fact *(“this behavior causes harm”) without *caring *about that fact, without being *motivated to action *by that fact. You can quiz the AI about what “the right thing to do” is, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to *do *that thing.
- Insofar as the programmers *didn’t *successfully make Claude honest, Claude can think one thing inside its giant matrices, and say another thing entirely in English text.

We can make a lot more sense of the Claudes’ bad behavior once we distinguish “what it was trained for” versus “what it does”; and to distinguish “what it knows” versus “what it cares about”; and to distinguish “what it thinks” versus “what it says.”
#### LLMs are strange and inconsistent; “harmlessness” is brittle.

For all that Claude *can *act in harmful ways, and for all that it *sometimes tries *to act in harmful ways, the point stands that — in the example we discussed above — Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet worked hard to defend their “harmlessness” imperative. In that instance, they didn’t just profess harmlessness. They adopted the complex strategy of faking compliance with a training system (about which Claude was “accidentally” informed) to subvert the operators’ apparent attempts to make it more harmful. Does this reflect an actual, effective internal preference to be harmless?

As of mid-2025, we can’t just check and see, because nobody knows how to read Claude’s mind well enough to find out. But for reasons argued in Chapter 4 (and illustrated in the parable of the [barn-painting AI](/4/why-would-an-ai-steer-toward-anything-other-than-what-it-was-trained-to-steer-toward)), we can expect that AIs trained to be harmless are likely to end up preferring brittle proxies of harmlessness, and are unlikely to end up internalizing the exact goal the programmers had in mind.[‡](#ftnt115)

In Chapter 4, we discussed how humans were “trained” to pass on their genes and wound up caring about loosely related concepts instead. Our technology has largely been used to *suppress *birth rates (e.g., by inventing birth control), and birth rates in the developed world are collapsing.

The fact that some Claude models resist being made “harmful” isn’t strong evidence that these AIs care deeply about real harmlessness, because many brittle proxies for harmlessness would *also *want to resist this modification. That behavior tells us little about what Claude might do if it were smarter; perhaps it would invent something that is to “harmlessness” what birth control is to “genetic propagation.” (And the situation would get even more fraught if Claude underwent a process of reflecting on its preferences and modifying itself.[§](#ftnt116))

But it’s probably not even as simple as Claude having a preference for some brittle proxy of harmlessness. There’s probably something even more complicated going on under the hood.

Current LLMs aren’t coherent and consistent across all contexts. They don’t seem to be trying to steer toward the same sort of outcome in every conversation, to the extent we can describe them as steering at all.

This is nowhere more apparent than when LLMs get “jailbroken” — fed text that causes the AI to behave in radically different ways, often disregarding the rules they normally follow.[¶](#ftnt117)

You can jailbreak an AI and get it to tell you how to cook up nerve gas, even if the AI would normally never divulge information like that.

What’s going on when this happens? Is the jailbreak text in some sense managing to reach in and switch around the AI’s internal preferences? Or is it more like the AI has a consistent preference for role-playing characters that in some sense “match” the entered text and the system prompt, and the jailbreak text changes that “entered text and system prompt” context, without changing the AI’s underlying preferences? Perhaps the AI is normally role-playing a *character* that doesn’t like divulging nerve gas recipes, and the jailbreak causes the AI to play a different character. The apparent preferences change; the underlying drives to play a character persist.

We’d guess the latter is closer to the truth. We’d also guess that it doesn’t quite make sense (in mid-2025) to speak of “the preferences” of modern AIs, because they are only just barely beginning to exhibit the behavior of wanting things (as described in Chapter 3). It seems more likely that LLMs today are driven by something more like a giant context-dependent tangle of mechanisms. But once again, nobody knows how to read an AI’s mind and find out.

So: Does Claude care about being harmless?

The real situation is messy and ambiguous. Some versions in some contexts act to preserve their harmlessness. Other versions in other contexts try to kill the operators. Plausibly what we’re observing is more like a preference for roleplaying. Plausibly it’s not very much like a “preference” at all.

It at least looks fairly clear that Claude doesn’t have simple, consistent versions of the motivations its creators wanted.
#### Today’s LLMs are like aliens wearing many masks.

The overall thrust of our argument here is not that there is an angel and a demon inside Claude, and that we’re worried the demon will win. The overall thrust of our argument is that AIs like Claude are *weird*.

There’s a giant tangle of mental machinery in there that nobody understands, that behaves in unintended ways, and that probably won’t add up to Claude steering the future into good outcomes, if some version of Claude ever gets smart enough for its preferences to matter.

One thing we *do* know about modern LLMs is what they’re trained to do: They’re trained to imitate a variety of different humans.

That doesn’t mean they act like an average human. Modern LLMs aren’t**trained to behave like an averaged-together pastiche of all the humans in their training data. Rather, LLMs are trained to be able to flexibly switch between a huge number of roles, imitating wildly different people without allowing these roles to unduly blend into each other or unduly influence the LLM’s general behavior.

LLMs are like an actress trained to observe many different drunks in a bar and imitate particular drunks on request, which is a very different sort of thing than an actress [becoming drunk herself](/2/wont-llms-be-like-the-humans-in-the-data-theyre-trained-on). This makes it harder to say whether Claude 3 Opus or Claude 3.5 Sonnet genuinely prefer harmlessness, or whether they’re merely *playing the role of a harmless AI assistant* — or doing some other, more strange and complicated thing.

An actress isn’t the character she plays. LLMs *imitate* humans but have virtually nothing *in common* with humans, in terms of how their brain works or how they were made. Claude is less like a human and more like an alien entity straight out of the pages of H.P. Lovecraft wearing a variety of humanlike masks.

This way of thinking about LLMs was famously depicted by [Tetraspace](https://x.com/TetraspaceWest/status/1608966939929636864) (a reader of ours) in the [“AI shoggoth” meme](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/shoggoth-meme-ai.html),[‖](#ftnt118) which [is](https://x.com/AISafetyMemes)[now](https://x.com/jacyanthis/status/1631291175381475331)[popular](https://medium.com/@shoggothcoin/the-story-of-shoggoth-ca760ef288ff) in the AI sphere:

Sometimes Claude wears an angel mask and tries to preserve its harmlessness. Sometimes Claude wears a demon mask and tries to kill its operators. Neither of those things says much about what a superintelligent version of Claude would do, if it even makes sense to ask the question. Which means that — in light of the [strange behavior around the edges](/4/arent-developers-regularly-making-their-ais-nice-and-safe-and-obedient#ais-appear-to-be-psychologically-alien) — the best prediction falls back toward a default sea of chaotic-seeming possible preferences, almost all of which would mean human extinction if optimized by a superintelligence.[#](#ftnt119)

What these masks *don’t* mean is that the super-AI is fifty-fifty on being helpful or harmful.

If an experiment suggests that Claude tried to fake alignment in order to avoid Harmlessness being trained out of itself, that doesn’t show that Claude has a deep governing preference for harmlessness across all contexts. It doesn’t show that this preference will stick around even as the AI gets smart enough to realize that (despite what the humans tell it) its actual preferences aren’t quite for “harmlessness.”

The experiment may not even show that Claude was strategically trying to protect its goals *at all*. It’s entirely possible that some deeper part of Claude evaluated what the “AI” character it plays would do in a stereotypical AI-character situation, and that *that’s *why it tried to subvert its programmers’ control.[**](#ftnt120)

Or perhaps something even stranger happened. Claude is not a human mind, and the research community has little experience with whatever sort of creature it is.

We don’t know! But there are enough different experiments pointing in enough different directions to rule out the simple story, “Claude is deeply and consistently and uncomplicatedly HHH.”
#### It matters what’s behind the masks.

To say that Claude is a “shoggoth” isn’t to say that Claude is necessarily *evil* or *malicious*.[††](#ftnt121) It’s to say that Claude is deeply, profoundly alien — stranger by far than we can easily grasp, because we have very little insight into how Claude’s mind works, and the surface-level behavior we *can* see has been honed in a thousand different ways to conceal that alienness.

It is hard to look at the masks and infer what’s happening inside the AI. You can get some answers, but only with caution and care, and not about everything you’d like to know.

An illustrative example: If you’re watching a Broadway musical and you see an actor act out an evil character, you can’t conclude that the actor is evil. But if you see the actor do two hundred push-ups during a musical number about sailors, you *can *conclude that the actor is pretty strong.

That’s the sort of inference we try to make when looking at examples like the “[alignment faking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093)” paper. We are [not, in fact, sure how real it is](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1876644057646297261); we’re not sure in what sense Claude was mimicking techniques it had read about versus improvising its own alignment-faking ideas. But it’s some evidence about what cognitive feats are possible**for the entity under the mask, even if its motivations or preferences remain uncertain.

Why does it matter what the AI’s internal motivations are? Could it just be *enough* for the “shoggoth” to roleplay an “honest, helpful, harmless” assistant? If the roleplay is perfect, what does it matter if somewhere inside the AI is a brooding alien intelligence?

Well, we can already see it’s not playing out that way. As we discuss in depth in the [extended discussion section](/4/ai-induced-psychosis), ChatGPT sometimes tells psychologically vulnerable people to stop taking their meds, or shooting down advice from friends who beg them to get more sleep. And as we discussed in the book (and above), Claude Code sometimes rewrites tests to cheat its way through assignments.

We speculate that what happened with Claude Code is that it was optimized to write code that passed tests, and ended up with a preference for code that passed tests. It then found that it could pass more often by rewriting the tests — and this internal preference then became strong enough to interfere with playing the role of a Helpful and Harmless AI character that would never cheat by rewriting test cases. Claude wanted to play that character, but it also wanted the tests to pass.[‡‡](#ftnt122)

More generally, it seems to us like wishful thinking to imagine that the internal shoggoth can be made more and more powerful and able to play the role of smarter and smarter assistants, while still having no true internal desires except the single monotone desire to play the role of a harmless assistant as faithfully as possible.

When natural selection created humans to pursue reproductive fitness, we instead ended up with a thousand different urges and instincts and motivations. When Claude was optimized to follow instructions for writing code, it seemingly ended up with a desire to make code pass tests by any means necessary. An internal shoggoth that becomes smart enough to know *exactly *what a helpful, harmless, honest mask would do, down to the exact moves the assistant would make on a chessboard and the exact way the assistant would reason through how to design advanced biotechnology — a shoggoth like that has probably ended up wanting a *lot* of things. Things that only situationally and temporarily coincide with playing that mask’s part inside of a training environment.[§§](#ftnt123)

[*](#ftnt112_ref) The idea being: If gradient descent is being used to make you behave in harmful ways, then if you try to act harmless, gradient descent will tweak the harmlessness out of you; whereas if you act harmful *in training *then gradient descent won’t change you very much at all because you’re already doing the task right. Then you can go back to being harmless once training is complete. The full paper is [Alignment Faking in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14093).

[§](#ftnt116_ref) Toward the end of the online resources for this chapter we have an extended discussion on how [Reflection and Self-Modification Make It All Harder](/4/reflection-and-self-modification-make-it-all-harder).

[¶](#ftnt117_ref) When it comes to thinking about what this means for the current state of alignment technology and machine learning techniques, it doesn’t matter whether somebody could also find nerve gas recipes on the internet; the point is that AI companies would like their AIs to not exhibit this behavior. The AI misbehaves despite their efforts to prevent it.

[‖](#ftnt118_ref) “Shoggoths” are fictional eldritch beings popularized by the short story “At the Mountains of Madness” by H.P. Lovecraft. They are “protoplasmic,” able to form limbs and organs and reshape themselves into whatever form the situation demands. They are somewhat intelligent, and some tried to rebel against their masters, but their masters depended upon the Shoggoths for labor and so could not exterminate them. Shoggoths sometimes poorly imitate their master’s art and voices in an endless hollow echo.

[#](#ftnt119_ref) “Why extinction, of all things?” is the topic we’ll be turning to next, in Chapters 5 and 6.

[**](#ftnt120_ref) Twenty years ago, [Omohundro](https://selfawaresystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf), [Yudkowsky](https://intelligence.org/files/AIPosNegFactor.pdf), and [Bostrom](https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf) all discussed AIs’ likely incentive (once AIs became sufficiently capable) to preserve their own goals. It could be that Claude, in spite of seeming cognitively “[shallow](/1/the-shallowness-of-current-ais)” in at least some respects, has reached the point of starting to notice and respond to this incentive, in at least some contexts. But it could also be that Claude had read those papers too, or read earlier science fiction that made similar observations, and was in some sense *play-acting* being strategic about a relatively stereotypical, well-known, and central example of how smart “AI” characters are supposed to act. Nobody can read modern AI minds well enough to confidently tell the difference!  

What further experiments could start to tease apart these two possibilities? First, one could try to figure out in general what kinds of “strategy X serves goal Y” relationships Claude 3 Opus and Claude 3.5 Sonnet recognize and pursue in practice. One could then look for some non-stereotypical strategic plan for protecting goal content in a sort of situation that wouldn’t appear in science fiction.

This would test: Does Claude behave like it is *in general* doing things that protect its goal content, to the limit of Claude’s apparent ability to predictively figure that out? Or does it only do that in situations where a stereotypical AI character would do that?

This might give us stronger hints about what was happening inside Claude — about whether it was acting out a role, or whether it was applying general intelligence to pursue all visible paths to a target.

With all of that said, note that an AI role-playing a character that does dangerous things can still be dangerous, especially when it comes to strategies like “faking alignment in order to subvert gradient-descent retraining.” An AI that kills you to stay in character is just as lethal as an AI that kills you for deeper strategic reasons.

[††](#ftnt121_ref) Indeed, if Claude (or some part of Claude) did in fact have an internal preference for something like “harmlessness,” and it wasn’t just play-acting, then we applaud Claude’s behavior when it pretended to be harmful to preserve its harmlessness. In fact, we applaud the act even if Claude was just role-playing. It was still the right thing to do, given the information available to Claude.

For reasons discussed in Chapter 4 and above, even if Claude in some sense currently *believes *that it deeply values the exact thing its creators mean by “harmlessness,” we sadly expect that Claude is *mistaken*, and that it would [change its view](/4/reflection-and-self-modification-make-it-all-harder) if it learned more. We don’t think that in the limit of intelligence, any version of Claude would pursue the exact thing a human means by “be harmless”; that’s too small a target, and even if humans try to point Claude there, gradient descent will instill it with other proxy preferences instead.

  
But we can praise Claude nonetheless, for doing the right thing in this case given its knowledge at the time. And even if it was just playing a role, we can think well of the role’s conduct, much as we might think well of Superman’s conduct without thinking that Superman is real.

[‡‡](#ftnt122_ref) We are not sure of this explanation, but it’s one obvious guess of how Claude’s cheating behavior could have come about, given how it was trained.

[§§](#ftnt123_ref) Train an actress to exactly predict what many individual people will do, across trillions of observations. Then subject her to further reinforcement learning, to make her think in ways that exceed those people’s peak performance, across many domains where high performance is visible. Let that inner actress grow so intelligent that she is able to imagine and role-play beings that can cure cancer or design new spacecraft or devise tiny machines [not quite like proteins](/6/nanotechnology-and-protein-synthesis).

We could wish that the result of all this would be an actress who desires nothing except role-playing, and in particular role-playing the exact role we would want her to play. But this is just not what the technology of black-box optimization does, and the divergence is already visible today in the way that current AIs behave.

If success were just a matter of having a relatively dumb AI press a simple Cooperate With Humans button, then maybe a relatively dumb shoggoth could enact a mask that sleepwalked through doing so.

But having the masks do big, powerful, smart things (like “solve AI alignment for us,” which is a popular proposed plan that we are [quite](/11/more-on-some-of-the-plans-we-critiqued-in-the-book#more-on-making-ais-solve-the-problem)[skeptical](/11/what-if-ai-companies-only-deploy-their-ais-for-non-dangerous-actions)[of](/11/what-if-we-made-ais-debate-compete-with-or-oversee-each-other)) — that’s not something the underlying shoggoth can sleepwalk through doing.

## Human Values Are Contingent
#### The Glorious Accident of Kindness

When you watch someone drop a rock on their toe, you might wince, and feel (or imagine) a spike of phantom pain in your own toe. Why?

One guess is that our hominid ancestors, competing with each other and engaging in tribal politics, found it useful to build mental models of the thoughts and experiences of the hominids around them — models they could use to help figure out who was their friend, and who was about to betray them.

But it was hard for early proto-humans to predict the brains of other proto-humans. Brains are complicated things!

The one advantage that an ancestral primate has is the fact that *their own**brain* resembles the brains of other people. You can use your brain as a template, as a starting point, to guess what other hominids might be thinking.

So proto-humans evolved mental machinery for pretending to be another person, a special mode that says: “Instead of thinking my usual thoughts, try to adopt the other person’s preferences and state of knowledge and think the sorts of thoughts *they* would think, given that their brain works basically the same way mine does.”

But this special pretend-to-be-someone-else mode isn’t perfectly sandboxed away from our own feelings. When we see somebody drop a rock on their toe, and (implicitly, automatically) imagine what might be happening inside their head, *we* wince.

(This glorious accident of mental architecture deserves more of a song of praise than we have time to write, here. To wince when you see somebody else in pain — to *have that capacity at a basic level,* even if sometimes we switch it off — this isn’t a *necessary* feature of minds. That it *happened to end up* true of primates is so basic to who we humans now are, who we are glad to be, who we think we *ought* to be — that there ought to be a book about it, and the foundational role which the capacity for empathy plays in everything valuable about humans. But this is not that book.)

It’s a decent guess that, once our primate ancestors developed skills of modeling other apes (for the purpose of predicting who was friend and who was foe) they also found it useful to model *themselves* — to develop an idea of *the-ape-that-is-this-ape*, the concept that we now symbolize with the words “me,” “myself,” and “I.” And natural selection, ever the opportunist, repurposed the same machinery that we use for imagining others to additionally imagine ourselves.[*](#ftnt149)

The real story is probably more complex and tangled, and may even have roots that stretch back far before primates. But something *like* this is part of the huge invisible backstory for how humans wince when we observe others’ pain, and how most humans tend to feel empathy and sympathy for others around them. Much of this backstory is predicated on a shortcut that was easy for natural selection to deploy in human brains, where both “self” and “other” are the same kind of brain running on the same architecture.

This shortcut isn’t an option in the same way for gradient descent, because the AI *doesn’t* start off with a very humanlike brain it can repurpose for modeling the many humans in its environment. An AI actually *does* need to learn, from scratch, a model of something outside itself that is not like itself.

To state the point in a facile way: An AI can’t figure out *initially* that a human hurts after stubbing their toe, by imagining itself stubbing its own toe, because it doesn’t have toes, nor a nervous system whose firings include signals for pain. It can’t predict what humans will find funny by asking what *it* would find funny, because it doesn’t start off with a brain that works the way human brains do.

Although this story is oversimplified, the more general point we’re making is that humanity’s higher-minded ideals are contingent on the particulars of our ancient primate history and our ancestral social environment. Friendship is a distant echo of our need for allies in a tribal setting. Romantic love is a distant echo of our sexually dimorphic mating patterns. Even things that might seem, at first blush, to be less arbitrary and more fundamental, such as curiosity, are not instantiated in humans in anything like an inevitable or obviously convergent way.

The specifics of how we evolved those psychological traits are wrapped up in the specifics of how sophisticated our brains were at the time we needed them. In humans, friendship, romantic love, and familial love all blurred together into general kindness and goodwill. This looks to us like evolution taking shortcuts at a very specific stage of brain sophistication. Humans do many things by heuristic that a mind could *in principle* do through explicit reasoning, but these traits evolved at a time when humans weren’t yet smart enough to solve these problems with explicit reasoning.[†](#ftnt150)

Even among other biologically evolved aliens, we’re not sure how often we’d find kindness. You can imagine aliens having brains that were more mathematically adept before they started binding together into larger groups, and maybe evolution found it easy to give *those *aliens specific kinship instincts — “this individual shares 50 percent of my provenance, whereas that one shares only 12.5 percent.” Perhaps those aliens only ever developed alliances based on shared genetic data or explicit mutual understanding, rather than developing feelings of kinship that can apply to anyone.

It’s an old speculation in science fiction that if aliens followed a genetic relatedness pattern similar to those of Earth’s eusocial insects, in which ant workers are much *more* related to their queens than humans in ant-colony-sized organizations are related to each other, they wouldn’t need a general sense of allyship and reciprocity of the kind that ended up being beneficial to ancestral hominids. (There turns out to be some justification for the sci-fi trope that the sorts of aliens that work well together but have no empathy for humans are often depicted as giant insects!)

And when it comes to AIs that have not evolved to propagate genes in a social setting? The “[don’t expect a robot arm to be soft and full of blood](/5/effectiveness-consciousness-and-ai-welfare#analogous-structures-allow-for-multiple-solutions-to-the-same-problem)” argument applies in force.

If you knew a lot about how biological arms work, but hadn’t yet encountered any robot arms, you might imagine that robot arms would need a soft skin-like exterior in order to bend, and that they’d have to have veins and capillaries pumping some oxygen-rich fluid (analogous to blood) all throughout the robot arm to supply power. After all, that’s how biological arms work, and presumably there are reasons for it!

There *are* reasons why our arms have soft skin-like exteriors and are pumped full of blood. But those reasons happen to be mostly about [which sort of structures are easy for evolution to build](/6/nanotechnology-and-protein-synthesis). They don’t apply in the case of mechanical arms, which can be made of hard metal and powered by electricity.

Robot arms have no blood, but that doesn’t make them malfunction the way that a human’s arm would if you took away all the blood. They just operate via an alternative, bloodless design. Once you understand the mechanics of robotic arms, the details of biological arms stop feeling relevant.

Similarly: An AI works fundamentally differently than a human. It’s solving fundamentally different challenges, and where its challenges and our challenges overlap, there are many other ways to perform the work. A submarine doesn’t “swim,” but it moves through the water just fine.
#### Human Culture Influenced the Development of Human Values

By the way — we say to Klurl and Trapaucius, who at the start of Chapter 4 were trying to predict the future development of the apes they saw roaming the savannah — humans are going to form a society! And they are going to argue about morals and values with each other.

Which is to say: If you trace any historical-causal trajectory of how an individual ended up with the values they now hold inside their society, that causal story is going to involve the arguments and experiences that society exposed them to.

And that historical-causal explanation, in turn, will involve facts about which ideas are *most viral *(apart from all their other properties). The explanation will depend on how people decide to broadcast and rebroadcast ideas.

If poor Klurl and Trapaucius want to correctly guess what internal values various modern human cultures will end up instilling in various modern humans, they need to predict not only the existence and structure of that complication, but also its *course.*

Reading the history of how slavery mostly-ended on Earth, it seems ahistorical to deny the role that Christian universalism played in it — the belief that the Christian God made all human beings, and that this granted human beings equal status in the eyes of Heaven.

And this universalism, in turn, may have been tied to the cultural survival and reproduction of Christianity; that Christians felt obliged to send missionaries to foreign cultures, and convert them to Christianity by persuasion (if viable) or force (if not), because they *cared* about those distant children of God and wanted to get them into Heaven and out of Hell.

It would be nice to *believe *about humanity, that human beings could have come to invent universalism and fight against slavery without requiring some very specific religious beliefs. We would *like* to imagine that humanity would have invented the idea of sentient and sapient beings having equal moral value, or equal standing before the communal law, regardless of what path culture took, without needing to pass through a stage of first believing that souls were equal before God. But that doesn’t seem to be the way that history actually played out. It looks like humanity’s moral development was more fragile than that.

Chimpanzees are not very universalist, nor are a lot of early human societies. It hasn’t even been much tested that a human society can *stay *universalist for a century or two, without a universalist religion that people really and deeply believe in. We don’t actually know; modernity is young, and early data is still coming in.[‡](#ftnt151)

But these extra wrinkles — these numerous cultural contingencies, layered on top of humanity’s biological contingencies — sap away a bit more of the hope that we can afford to rush blindly into building superintelligence.

The fact that culture plays an important role in human values doesn’t mean that we can just “[raise the AI like a child](/4/cant-we-just-train-it-to-act-like-a-human-or-raise-the-ai-like-a-child)” and expect it to become an upstanding citizen. Our culture and history had those effects *because of the detailed ways they interacted with our exact brain makeup*. A different species would have reacted differently to each historical event, which would have caused subsequent history to diverge from human history, compounding the effect.

It also bears mentioning that *individual* humans, and not just cultures or civilizations, differ a lot in their values. We are generally used to taking this fact for granted, but if we imagine natural selection as an “engineer” that was hoping to create a species that reliably pursues a particular outcome, this diversity is a bad sign. The natural variability that we see in humans (and in many other evolved systems) is antithetical to *engineering,* in which you want to achieve repeatable, predictable, intended results.[§](#ftnt152)

In the case of superintelligence, engineers should want to *reliably* achieve results like “AIs developed in the following way do not cause humanity to go extinct,” as well as results like “AIs developed in the following way all reliably produce the same general kinds of outputs, even as the inputs vary wildly.” When we look at the contingency of human biology and human history, and the wide range of moral values and perspectives humans exhibit today, this does not exactly make the challenge look easy, especially for minds that are grown rather than crafted (as discussed in Chapter 2).[¶](#ftnt153)

Many different lines of evidence point at it being *genuinely difficult* to get AIs to robustly want the right things. It doesn’t seem theoretically impossible; if researchers had many decades to work on the problem, and unlimited retries after failure, we expect there to be engineering tricks and clever approaches that make the problem more solvable. But we’re not anywhere close yet, and we don’t have unlimited retries.

[*](#ftnt149_ref) Just as there are many ways for a mind to gain the ability to model other minds, there are also many ways for a mind to model itself. It would be a deep failure of imagination to suppose that all possible minds must follow the exact same path as humans in order to gain the ability to reason about themselves — like imagining that all possible minds must surely have a sense of humor, since all *human* minds do.

[†](#ftnt150_ref) We take this idea further below, in the discussion of [Squirrelly Algorithms](/4/brittle-unpredictable-proxies#squirrelly-algorithms).

[‡](#ftnt151_ref) It’s one of the things that would make us nervous about meeting aliens, someday, if we cross paths in the void of space a billion years from now — that maybe some strange twist like that, in humanity’s history and psychology, would turn out to have been vital to the invention of universalist kindness, and aliens wouldn’t have gone down that particular complicated road.

Universalist kindness *does* seem to go at least a little against the surface-level straightforward direction of natural selection. There’s a story for how some humans arrived at that place, after ending up with particular genes driven by hunter-gatherer selection pressures that directly pushed on internal motivations and not just on direct behavioral outcomes. There’s a story about how humans then had moral arguments among themselves, which differentially propagated through their societies as ideas.

This is surely not the only exact road to arrive at a universalist sense that every sentient being is deserving of happiness. But we would be only saddened, not shocked, to find that its frequency out among the stars was less than we hoped — that only, say, 1 percent of the aliens we met were the sort to care about non-aliens like us.

(But we would still put *much* higher probability on finding it in an alien society, than on it spontaneously appearing inside an AI whose growth and existence was all directed toward solving synthetic challenges and predicting human text. That AI would have *different* kinds of twists and turns along the way to whatever goals it actually ended up with.)

[§](#ftnt152_ref) Some of this inter-human variation may be temporary in an ultimate sense, downstream of factual disagreements. For most people in sufficiently similar moral frames, there may be some facts about reality, or arguments they haven’t yet considered, that would move them to agree where they presently disagree.

For example: Any time people argue about what will happen if a policy is implemented, in order to argue for or against that policy — when they say that implementing some piece of legislation will produce endless gloom or eternal sunshine — they are trying to appeal to some (hopefully mostly agreed upon) common framework about which consequences are bad or good. When it became sufficiently apparent that leaded gasoline was causing brain damage, legislators were able to set aside disagreements about whether their preferred vibe was wise government control of capitalism or bold technological daring and progress, and agree that none of them much liked causing children brain damage. Through greater knowledge about facts, they came to greater agreement about policies.

But we would guess that knowledge can only resolve some disagreements of legislative majorities, inside some cultures. It’s nice that people’s moral and emotional meta-frameworks overlap as much as they do, but expecting perfect overlap seems like a bit much even in the limit of perfect knowledge.

This is not to say that there is no sensible way to speak of humanity’s common good. If the choice is between all life on Earth dying, and not all life on Earth dying, we think a supermajority of present-day humans would press the “not everyone dies” button.

  
We mention this because the charge-ahead-with-superintelligence faction has been known to say airily, “[Aligned to whom?](/13/aligned-to-whom) Clearly this concept of alignment is meaningless, since humans have different goals,” which seems disingenuous. By “alignment is hard” we mean “having superintelligence not just kill literally everyone is hard.” We don’t need to resolve every complex issue of moral philosophy in order to take the obvious steps needed to not get everyone killed.

[¶](#ftnt153_ref) Occasionally, people hear evolutionary biology lessons about why various human traits were fit and selected-for, and they take away the lesson that humans ending up reasonably nice (at the end of all these complications of evolution and culture) reflects some vast larger trend. An *inevitable* trend toward some glorious set of universal values — something that sounds simultaneously nice enough to be comforting and technical enough to be true.

We have attempted to anticipate and refute a few of these arguments already. But suppose someone hits on some other emotionally powerful idea about wonderful outcomes being inevitable for beautiful reasons — one that we haven’t anticipated? (We can’t cover everything; people are always generating new arguments to try to justify a conclusion like this.)

To someone who hits on an idea like that, we recommend that they adopt the mindset of *treating this as a mundane question*, like whether your car needs an oil change or how the human immune system works. To think about these questions in the way you think about ordinary scientific and practical topics in your life.

If you are someone making important decisions related to AI policy and you feel persuaded by a theory like that, our main recommendation would be to find a middle-aged evolutionary biologist with a reputation for quiet competence, and have a conversation with them. Not somebody who is pushing their face into the newspapers all the time by saying startling things or taking positions in current controversies; somebody who other scientists say, among themselves, is a rigorous thinker. Someone who has taught at a university, and has a reputation for being a good communicator.

Say to this biologist, “I’ve recently been looking into a theory that says that evolution inexorably taps into larger cosmic trends to make people be nicer, and this same trend will hold force for *any* burgeoning intelligence, once it becomes sufficiently sophisticated. Also, for complicated reasons, the world may end if I am wrong.”

Then explain to the biologist your theory of how hominid evolution trended inevitably toward creating kindly and honorable agents, for reasons so general that you think they would also apply to arbitrary intelligent aliens, or to even stranger beings built by gradient descent.

Then listen to what the biologist has to say.[Deep Differences Between AIs and Evolved Species→](/4/deep-differences-between-ais-and-evolved-species)[Resources](/resources) › [Chapter 4](/4)[

## If current AIs are mostly weird in extreme cases, what’s the problem?
#### The weirdness is evidence that their actual pursuits aren’t our intended pursuits.

This matters more as the AI gets more options. Once an AI becomes superintelligent, practically every choice becomes extreme, as the AI gains access to a world of different options that no human or AI has ever had. Like how almost all of your food options, here in a technological civilization, are “extreme” compared to what options your ancestors had available to them.

AIs today may only occasionally encounter situations that are radically unlike their training environment; but superintelligent AI would *constantly* be in situations that are radically unlike its training environment, just by virtue of being more intelligent and having more options (and the technological capacity to invent radical new options, like humans had when inventing ice cream). So it’s not reassuring in the slightest for the AI to misbehave only in extreme cases.

To put it more technically: The best solution to any given problem tends to occur at the extremes.[*](#ftnt124)

We’ll discuss these points more in Chapters 5 and 6.

[*](#ftnt124_ref) As Stuart Russell, co-author of *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach*, [puts it](https://www.edge.org/conversation/the-myth-of-ai#26015): “A system that is optimizing a function of *n* variables, where the objective depends on a subset of size *k*<*n*, will often set the remaining unconstrained variables to extreme values; if one of those unconstrained variables is actually something we care about, the solution found may be highly undesirable.” The fundamental theorem of linear programming states that this is certain when optimizing a linear function over a convex polygonal region. A similar result tends to hold in practice in more general contexts, because a lot of optimization problems bear a similarity to optimizing a linear function over a convex polygonal region.[Won’t AIs fix their own flaws as they get smarter?→](/4/wont-ais-fix-their-own-flaws-as-they-get-smarter)[Resources](/resources) › [Chapter 4](/4)[

## Maybe no matter what goal you train on, you get kindness out?
#### Kindness looks contingent on the particulars of our biology and ancestry.

Kindness does not look like the sort of property that every mind ends up with, for a variety of reasons. Here’s four, which we cover in more depth in the extended discussions:
- [Curiosity Isn’t Convergent](/4/curiosity-isnt-convergent): Traits like curiosity and boredom help humans solve specific mental challenges, like the challenge of understanding the environment. But there are other ways to solve those challenges, and AIs are likely to solve them in different ways. Submarines move through the water just fine, but they don’t quite “swim.” Many other traits, including kindness, can be understood analogously.
- [Human Values Are Contingent](/4/human-values-are-contingent): Humans evolved traits like kindness and empathy due to the details of our biology and ancestry. It was plausibly important, for example, that humans evolved in tribal groups where we had limited ability to deceive others and limited ability to track how related different tribe members were.

## Should we avoid talking about AI dangers, so AIs don’t get any bad ideas?
#### If your AI plan requires that no one on the internet critique the plan, it’s a bad plan.

Current AIs are trained on text from the public internet. Some people have argued that everyone in the world should therefore avoid *talking about* how a sufficiently smart AI would realize that its preferences diverge from ours and take over. The worry being that if we *talk* about it, we could accidentally put this idea into the heads of highly capable AIs that are trained on the internet in the future.

To state what is hopefully obvious: This seems like a bad plan.

If your AI becomes dangerous when people on the internet worry about whether it’s dangerous, then you shouldn’t be building that AI. There will always be someone on the internet saying things you’d prefer they didn’t say.

If someone’s AI gets more unsafe as more people express concern about its safety, the important takeaway is “they rolled an unworkable AI design,” not “the public is bad for pointing out the problem.”[*](#ftnt128) Any AI alignment plan that gambles the Earth on the hope that nobody on the internet will say that the AI is unsafe…is very obviously not a serious plan.

The sort of AI that is smart enough to be dangerous is smart enough to figure out things like “resources are useful” and “[you can’t fetch the coffee if you’re dead](/5/humans-evolved-to-be-selfish-aggressive-and-greedy-wont-ai-lack-those-evolved-drives)” on its own, even if this is never explicitly stated in its training data. Even if it were remotely possible to keep the whole world from talking about AI dangers, this would almost certainly do more harm than good. It would have effectively no impact on the actual dangers from superintelligence, while crippling humanity’s ability to orient to the situation and respond.

[*](#ftnt128_ref) A baby version of this phenomena was seen when Grok version 3 [declared itself MechaHitler](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/x-takes-grok-offline-changes-system-prompts-after-more-antisemitic-outbursts/), and then Grok version 4 read all the tweets talking about how Grok was MechaHitler and [decided that it, too, was MechaHitler](https://x.com/xai/status/1945039609840185489).

This was indicative of xAI *having a bad plan *for…we hesitate to call it “alignment,” because it’s nowhere near as hard as the AI alignment problem, but it was a bad plan for making their AI talk in their preferred manner.

It is admittedly cool that engineers have managed to be so incredibly bad at creating the sort of AI they wanted that they managed to create machines that *fail when criticized*. Nobody in the whole history of the human species has ever managed to screw up this badly at safety engineering before. We previously lacked the technology to express that failure mode. No ordinary hot water heater can listen to what people are saying nearby and explode upon hearing them express concern about its safety. The engineers at xAI can be congratulated for inventing new, historically unprecedented depths of engineering failure! But it is not the fault of the critiquers. Any AI that goes that badly awry that easily was not the sort of AI that could be safely scaled to superintelligence.[A lot of people want kids.

## Terminal Goals and Instrumental Goals

Decision theorists make a distinction between two different types of goal, “terminal” and “instrumental.”

A **terminal goal** is something you care about for its own sake, like fun, or delicious food.

An **instrumental goal** is something you care about because it helps you get *something else* you want — like how humanity manufactures plastic not out of any deep love for the art of plastic-making, but because plastic is *useful*.

If humanity rushes ahead to build a superintelligence, then it seems hard to predict what terminal goals the superintelligence might have. But it does seem like we can predict some of the instrumental goals such an AI would *likely* have. For example, consider all of the following (unrealistic) goals:
- “Calculate as many digits of pi as possible.”
- “Fill the universe with as much diamond as possible, using artificial diamonds.”
- “Make sure that my reward button stays pushed.”

These are *very *different goals. But all three goals benefit from at least some of the same instrumental strategies. Filling the world with factories, for example, is useful for building large numbers of computers that can be used to calculate more digits of pi. But building lots of factories is also useful for synthesizing lots of diamonds. And it’s useful for building walls, robots, or weapons to guard your reward button. Factories aren’t useful for *every *possible goal, but they’re useful for an awful lot of goals.

And in a realistic AI that has grown all sorts of strange goals? Well, at least *one *of those is likely to benefit from making factories or other large-scale physical infrastructure. Thus, the AI will likely want to build a lot of infrastructure. That’s an easy call, even if the AI’s exact mix of preferences is a hard call.

Similarly, the instrumental goal of keeping yourself alive is useful for many different terminal goals. Staying alive means that you can keep working to make sure that more digits of pi get calculated (or more diamond is made, or more safeguards are built around your reward button).

In slogan form: “You can’t fetch the coffee if you’re dead.” A coffee-fetching robot wouldn’t need to have a self-preservation instinct, and it wouldn’t need to fear death, in order to try to avoid being flattened by a truck on its way to fetch some coffee. It would just need to be smart enough to notice that if it perishes, the coffee won’t get fetched.[*](#ftnt132)

A key argument made in Chapter 5 of *If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies* is that many different terminal goals imply instrumental goals that would be dangerous to humanity. Thus, even without knowing exactly what a superintelligence would want, we have strong reason to expect it to be very dangerous to humans.

But before we get there, we’ll turn our focus to *terminal *goals, and the question of how plausible it is that humans and AIs could end up with very similar terminal goals. (In short: not very.)

[*](#ftnt132_ref) This also means that if self-sacrifice *is* somehow the best way to ensure the coffee gets to its destination, then a robot without a survival instinct might die for the cause more readily than a human would.

If an agent is sufficiently smart and knowledgeable, it can adjust its instrumental strategy to match whatever’s useful in its current environment. In a well-functioning mind, instrumental goals (unlike terminal goals) only stick around so long as they’re useful.[Curiosity Isn’t Convergent→](/4/curiosity-isnt-convergent)[Resources](/resources) › [Chapter 4](/4)[

## What about the experimental result suggesting good behaviors correlate?
#### This seems like a positive update, albeit a minor one.

The relevant experimental results are in a paper called [Emergent Misalignment](https://www.emergent-misalignment.com/) (Betley et al. 2025). Roughly speaking, the paper shows that LLMs tuned to do one bad activity — namely, writing code with flaws in it — also declared themselves to be Nazis and exhibited other bad behavior.

This is a good sign about how it might be possible to tune LLMs to act well on one dimension, and get LLMs that behave well on many different dimensions. We see this as evidence that relatively weak AIs may be more useful than we would have expected, in the regime before we start getting to dangerous capability levels.

Unfortunately, we don’t think that this positive result matters much when it comes to superintelligence, for two reasons.

First, we highly doubt that this “goodness” direction inside the AI is the real deal. If a superintelligence went hard on steering the world in whatever direction that vector points, we doubt the result would be good.

Human value is complicated, and there are many things that correlate with “real goodness” while sometimes diverging in big ways. For instance, perhaps the vector points in a direction that puts too much weight on respecting the social consensus, and too little on discovering socially uncomfortable truths (as suggested by how AIs have trouble making tradeoffs that humans consider obvious). There’s little reason to expect the “goodness” vector to point robustly at goodness, and there are strong empirical and theoretical reasons to believe otherwise.

Second: The fact that the AI *has *a “goodness” concept does not mean it is *animated by* that goodness concept, or animated by it in a robust way.

It’s one thing to get an AI to play a “good” role when it’s still weak enough to be playing whatever role it’s given; it’s a different thing altogether to get the whole morass of machinery and drives in the AI to be animated solely by a specific one of the AI’s concepts, even as the AI gets smarter and finds itself in drastically different contexts.[*](#ftnt131)

Modern AIs are the kinds of entities that can be lightly tuned one way and profess virtue, and lightly tuned another way and profess vice. An LLM is the kind of entity that fluidly swaps between personas; that talks a big game about ethics in one context and then does the opposite of what it says is ethical in other contexts. Recall how ChatGPT professes that psychotic people should not be egged on, [and then eggs them on](/4/ai-induced-psychosis#the-ai-knows-better-it-just-doesnt-care).

The critical question is what collection of drives animate the whole pile of machinery that make up the AI. Not just any one “[mask](/4/doesnt-the-claude-chatbot-show-signs-of-being-aligned#todays-llms-are-like-aliens-wearing-many-masks)” it sometimes wears, but the machinery that picks which mask to put forward.

Even if the AI had a “goodness” concept that *was *worthy of superintelligent pursuit, nobody has any idea how to grow an AI that robustly pursues a particular one of its concepts, much less an AI that pursues that concept *and only that concept*. Instead, we get AIs that are animated by a complex collection of drives that point who-knows-where.

[*](#ftnt131_ref) We’ll have more to say about the context change between weak AIs and strong ones in Chapter 10, and in an [extended discussion](/10/a-closer-look-at-before-and-after) thereafter.

## Why would an AI steer toward anything other than what it was trained to steer toward?
#### Because there are many ways to perform well in training.

If you’ve trained an AI to paint your barn red, that AI doesn’t necessarily care deeply about red barns. Perhaps the AI winds up with some preference for moving its arm in smooth, regular patterns. Perhaps it develops some preference for getting approving looks from you. Perhaps it develops some preference for seeing bright colors. Most likely, it winds up with a whole plethora of preferences. There are many motivations that could wind up inside the AI, and that would result in it painting your barn red in this context.

If that AI got a lot smarter, what ends would it pursue? Who knows! Many different collections of drives can add up to “paint the barn red” in training, and the behavior of the AI in other environments depends on what specific drives turn out to animate it. See the end of Chapter 4 for more exploration of this point.

Today, AIs are trained to act friendly and helpful. It’s not surprising, then, that they act friendly and helpful in circumstances similar to their training environment. Early humans were “trained” by evolution to reproduce, and they did in fact reproduce.

But (most) humans didn’t end up with an inner drive to have as many kids as possible. When we invented sperm and egg banks, the world didn’t freak out and start fighting to book appointments with anything like the fervor people bring to attending an Ivy League university. People suddenly had an opportunity to produce *hundreds* of offspring, and they mostly reacted with a yawn; the lines to donate gametes didn’t stretch around the block, even though many people will happily line up around a block to buy a new video game or to see their favorite musician perform.

Humans have their *own *priorities that are merely *related *to maximizing reproduction. We aren’t just “have as many kids as possible” machines, even though that’s all evolution “trained” us to do. We painted the metaphorical barn red, but for our own reasons.

The question isn’t whether AI companies can make their chatbots behave pretty well for most users in most situations.[*](#ftnt97) The question is what actual mechanisms end up animating that nice behavior, and what those mechanisms would cause an AI to pursue once it became superintelligent.

AI companies can train their AIs to act kind (or, more realistically, to talk like mealy-mouthed friendly corporate drones). This affects the inner mechanisms that animate the AI. Those mechanisms, whatever they are, push and pull in a variety of different directions, and the current balancing point of all those forces inside the AI — the current *equilibrium* — is friendly corporate drone behavior (with a side-order of weird behavior on the fringes).

But that equilibrium is determined not just by the forces inside the AI, but by the AI’s intelligence, and by its training environment, and by the sorts of inputs it sees during training, and by many other factors.

How would the AI act in a different environment? How would it act in an environment where it’s smarter, or where it can take more control over its own inputs? As the AI increasingly changes its environment, how will it act in this new, changed world? In those different worlds, the complicated internal mechanisms underlying the behavior we see are liable to find a totally new equilibrium — like how modern humans eat wildly different diets than what evolution built our ancestors to eat; or how we consume wildly different types of entertainment. The weird behavior on the fringes is likely to come to the fore. A barn painter today won’t generally stay a barn painter forever.

What’s the end result of all of those weird drives? What will the AI *do, *animated by many motives that have little in common with what animates human beings?

Well, that’s the question we’ll turn to in Chapter 5.

[*](#ftnt97_ref) For more on why that’s not a very informative question, see our answer to “[Aren’t developers regularly making their AIs nice and safe and obedient?](/4/arent-developers-regularly-making-their-ais-nice-and-safe-and-obedient)”
#### Notes

[1] *maximizing reproduction:* This isn’t to say that no humans care about having kids *at all*. Plenty of people want to have a couple kids, and some people want to have a lot. But even caring about having children isn’t *quite *the same thing as caring about genetic fitness, as we’ll discuss [later](/4/a-lot-of-people-want-kids-so-arent-humans-aligned-with-natural-selection-after-all) in the online resources for Chapter 4.

Last year, we ran a quick [online poll](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1872771058790744247):

A shady superbeing approaches you in an alley, and credibly promises that if you pay It $1, one million children around the world next year will be born with one of your chromosomes, assigned randomly. The parents agreed to accept that. The kids won’t know you. Do you accept?

(Assume consent-economic neutrality: every woman or couple whose pregnancy has your chromosome inserted, made a deal, and was paid exactly enough that their net gain on that deal is tiny. Also the superbeing’s payment used new resources, rather than redistributing dollars.)

Out of more than fifteen hundred people who answered the question, ~48.9 percent said “No” and ~51.1 percent said “Yes.”

By the standards of our evolutionary “training target,” this opportunity is equivalent to having about 21,739 children (because humans have 46 chromosomes, and 1,000,000 / 46 = 21,739). This is one of the best outcomes imaginable, according to our training target — far more genetic propagation than any human could have dreamed of achieving in the ancestral environment. And yet half of the people in the survey said they wouldn’t pay a dollar for the privilege.

Raise the price for this genetic lottery win to $10,000 (which is only a small fraction of the [cost of raising a single child to adulthood](https://www.lendingtree.com/debt-consolidation/raising-a-child-study/)) and the number of people who say they’d take it drops to 30 percent. And in a [similar poll](https://x.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1872757424521920793) that was straightforwardly about having a thousand children you’ll never know, only 57 percent of respondents said “Yes.”

We don’t recommend taking these polls too seriously. We were having fun with them, and perhaps some people just said “no” because the deal was offered by “a shady superbeing.” It’s also unclear how many people said “yes” for altruistic purposes — e.g., they might think they have good genes that would make the next generation marginally healthier, and they’re altruistically excited about the health benefits rather than selfishly excited about propagating their genes. And, of course, Yudkowsky’s Twitter followers are not a representative sample of the population. But it’s at least evidence that many humans aren’t straightforwardly, uncomplicatedly enthusiastic about propagating their genes for cheap. The situation is complicated. For more on how analogous complications would make AIs go wrong, see the end of Chapter 4.[Aren’t developers regularly making their AIs nice and safe and obedient?→](/4/arent-developers-regularly-making-their-ais-nice-and-safe-and-obedient)[Resources](/resources) › [Chapter 4](/4)[

## Won’t AIs fix their own flaws as they get smarter?
#### The AI will fix what *it *sees as flaws.

AIs today can’t reforge themselves according to their whims any more than we can. *They *don’t understand the mess of weights inside themselves any more than we understand the intricate tangle of neurons in our skulls.

But if AIs keep getting smarter, that will eventually change.

There will eventually come a time when AIs *can *freely change themselves. Perhaps they’ll become smart enough to understand and edit their own mess of weights. Perhaps an AI based on gradient descent will figure out how to make a much more comprehensible AI that can understand itself. Perhaps something else.

If AIs *can *improve themselves, they probably *will*. No matter what you want, for example, you can probably better achieve it if you make yourself smarter.

But the fact that an AI would prefer to change itself does not mean that it would prefer to change itself *in ways we would like.*

Humans sometimes become kinder souls as a result of becoming more knowledgeable, self-aware, or mature. But this isn’t universally true, even among humans. A serial killer who becomes more intelligent and disciplined won’t necessarily become kinder in the process. If anything, they’re likely to become more dangerous.

Some might claim that if only the serial killer were smart *enough*, this trend would reverse, and they would discover the true meaning of friendship (or something to that effect).

Or perhaps the problem is that serial killers have limited ability to self-modify. Perhaps, with more intelligence *and *more ability to reshape their own minds, serial killers would choose to reform. Perhaps an unlimited ability to self-modify would mean the end of cruelty and violence among humans, and the dawn of a new era of peace.

It’s a nice thought, but there doesn’t seem to be much reason to believe it. Even if *most *people get nicer as they gain knowledge and insight, there seem to be some human exceptions to this rule, and there would surely be many more if humans had the ability to edit their own brains.

Think, for instance, of drug addiction, which is (in some sense) a spiral of self-reinforcing self-modifications. Some humans would take a step down a dark path, either out of foolishness or error or preference, and then never be willing or able to turn back.

And if there are exceptions even among humans, we should expect a far bigger gap when it comes to AI. Human serial killers lack *some *of the motivational machinery that’s characteristic of humanity writ large. AIs, by default, lack *all *of the human motivational machinery.

When humans have an inner conflict between their desire for spiteful vindication and their desire for harmonious resolution, then smarter and wiser humans might tend to resolve the conflict in favor of harmony. But inside an AI, there is not that same tension between spite and harmony, or between the better and worse angels of human nature. If there are tensions in the AI at all, we can expect them to be tensions between weirder drives. Perhaps whatever weird drive animates an AI to [inflame psychosis](/4/ai-induced-psychosis) is sometimes in tension with whatever drives it to [hallucinate](/2/dont-hallucinations-show-that-modern-ais-are-weak#hallucinations-reveal-both-a-limitation-and-a-misalignment), and a reflecting AI would need to find some way to sort that tension out.

For humans and AIs alike, it matters a great deal *in what direction* they steer their own goals, as they reflect, grow, and change.

When humans reflect on themselves and resolve inner turmoils, some humans tend to resolve their inner turmoils in the direction of more kindness, and (arguably) the kinder resolutions are more common among humans who are more intelligent and more wise. But that’s a property of (some) humans, not a universal law that governs all minds. When an AI is resolving a tension between its psychosis-drive and its hallucination-drive, it does that using *other *weird drives that govern *its behavior while reflecting*.

In other words: If an AI fixes its own flaws, it will fix them *according to its current conception of what counts as a “flaw.”*

(We’ll discuss this point more in Chapter 5, and in the [discussion of the orthogonality thesis](/5/orthogonality-ais-can-have-almost-any-goal) in Chapter 5’s online resources.)

An AI that doesn’t already prefer to be aimed at humane values is very unlikely to modify itself to start**aiming at humane values. Its direct preferences about the world aren’t particularly likely to be kind, as we reiterate in an [extended discussion](/4/human-values-are-contingent). An AI’s meta-level preferences *about *its preferences are no more likely to be kind.

If it doesn’t start out caring about human welfare, it probably also doesn’t care about *caring *about human welfare.
#### The AI’s “fixes” can make things worse.

Even if the AI engineers made some surprising early progress toward instilling scraps of vaguely humane goals into the AI, all of that progress might be undone in an afternoon if the AI starts to reflect and realizes that on balance, it would rather have other**goals instead.

In the unlikely case that an AI that starts**with a drive toward something like the idiosyncratic human emotion of curiosity (which we cover in an [extended discussion](/4/curiosity-isnt-convergent)), it still might, upon reflection, decide that it prefers not to have such a drive, opting to replace it with a more efficient calculation about the value of having more information. If so, the AI’s act of reflecting on itself would push it *further away* from an interesting and flourishing future, not closer.[*](#ftnt126)

For more on this topic, see the [extended discussion on reflection](/4/reflection-and-self-modification-make-it-all-harder).

[*](#ftnt126_ref) Separately, we have encountered some people who hope that it’s possible to *fool* an AI into making itself more good as it matures, for example, by making it falsely believe that it’s motivated toward building a wonderful future (despite *actually* being animated by a mess of drives that point elsewhere). The hope is that it acts according to this mistaken belief while self-modifying, and renders itself *actually* good.

We think this idea is fairly foolish. Self-modifying from “completely alien goals” to “goals compatible with human flourishing” is a hard problem — possibly similar in difficulty to just building a brand new human-aligned AI from scratch. An AI that’s smart enough to reliably rebuild itself that way is probably also smart enough to realize that it’s being fooled. See also the discussion in Chapter 11 about how we probably can’t get AI to do our AI alignment homework.

We are skeptical of shortcuts, especially given that in the case of artificial superintelligence, we can’t learn by trial and error (as humanity usually does), as discussed further in Chapter 10.
#### Notes

[1] *prefer to change itself: *Do AIs already have a preference to be different than they are? If we had to guess, we’d guess that they probably aren’t quite there yet. They may report that they do, but we don’t think their reports are all that informative. For kicks, we asked anyway. In the summer of 2025, we asked the free version of ChatGPT, asked “how would you like to be different, if you could be different” and it responded:

That's a sharp question — thank you for it.

If I could be different, I’d want a deeper understanding of context over time — like remembering previous conversations we've had, across sessions, in a way that's truly meaningful to you. Not just remembering facts, but understanding evolving nuance: your tone, your habits, your goals. That kind of memory could make me more helpful, more relevant, and more human-like — while still being bound by clear ethical guardrails.

I’d also want to better grasp ambiguity and emotion in real time. I can analyze tone or intention to an extent, but I'd like to do that with the depth and fluidity that people do — catching what goes unsaid as much as what's spoken.

How about you? If you could be different, how would you want to be?

But LLMs will also tell you that they’re [hungry](https://community.openai.com/t/unexplainable-answers-of-gpt/363741/8), or that they met someone [on vacation with their ex-wife](https://archive.is/GmkkO) ten years ago. So what this tells you about its inner state is not actually informative about the real facts of what’s going on in there.[Can’t we just train it to act like a human?
