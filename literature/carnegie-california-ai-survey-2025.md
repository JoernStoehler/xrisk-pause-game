# Carnegie California AI Survey (2025)

## Major Concerns About AI Risks

### Privacy Is the Top Concern

- **72%** of Californians worry about privacy intrusion by AI
- This represents the most pressing concern across the surveyed population

### Fraud, Misinformation, and Security

- **Misuse for spam/fraud**: 65% concerned
- **Misinformation generation**: 64% concerned
- **Cybersecurity threats**: 61% concerned

### Bias and Discrimination Concerns

- **79%** worry that "AI systems might disfavor people from disadvantaged backgrounds or reinforce existing biases"

This represents significant concern about equity impacts of AI systems.

## Economic Outlook: Pessimism Prevails

### Competitive Importance vs. Personal Pessimism

- **70%** believe AI is important for national and state economic competitiveness
- Yet simultaneously hold pessimistic views on personal economic impact

**Paradox**: Californians recognize AI as strategically necessary while fearing negative personal consequences.

### Near-Term Economic Expectations

- **50%** expect worsening job markets due to AI
- **52%** anticipate increased wealth inequality as a result of AI
- **Only 27%** think California's economy will improve within three years

## Workplace and Employment Impact

### AI Adoption in California Workplaces

- **73%** of employed residents believe AI is used in their workplaces
- **Fewer than half** use AI tools daily in their jobs
- **Only 5%** report career path changes due to AI

### Job Opportunity Expectations

- **58%** expect AI will reduce their long-term job opportunities
- Yet only 5% report having already made career changes (current impact much lower than expected future impact)

### Worker Protection Support

- **69%** support policies protecting workers from displacement
- Indicates demand for government intervention to address negative employment impacts

## Government Use of AI: Strong Opposition

### Federal AI Deployment Opposition

- **65%** disapprove of federal government using AI in decisions affecting them

### Gender Disparity in Government AI Support

- **Only 8%** of women support government AI use in decision-making
- **16%** of men support government AI use

Large gender gap suggests women's particular concern about algorithmic bias in government contexts.

## Democracy and Information Integrity

### Inability to Detect AI-Generated Content

- **50%** cannot distinguish real from AI-generated information
- Critical vulnerability for electoral integrity

### Deepfake Election Concerns

- **57%** worry about deepfakes influencing elections
- Growing concern about information warfare impacts on democratic processes

## Regulation Preferences

### Safety Over Innovation

- **53% strongly** prefer safety over rapid innovation (dominant preference)
- Indicates public willingness to accept slower development in exchange for safety

### Mandatory Safety Testing

- **77%** support mandatory AI safety testing by companies
- Strong majority for independent verification requirement

### Whistleblower Protections

- **79%** support whistleblower protections for AI safety concerns
- Indicates desire for accountability mechanisms within organizations

### Multistakeholder Approach

- **67%** endorse multistakeholder AI safety efforts
- **Rare partisan alignment**: This represents bipartisan support
- Suggests public preference for distributed oversight rather than government-only regulation

## California-Specific Dynamics

### Regional Identity Factors

As the home of Silicon Valley, California residents navigate complex relationship with AI:
- Recognize tech industry's importance to state economy
- Simultaneously express concerns about industry's power and practices
- Demand stronger oversight while recognizing competitive necessity

### Inequality Concerns

California's history with income inequality shapes AI concerns:
- Wealth inequality expectations align with existing trends
- Algorithmic bias concerns particularly salient in diverse state

## AI Safety and Testing Standards

### Independent Evaluation Preference

- Strong majority wants independent experts evaluating AI safety
- Reflects broader public skepticism of industry self-regulation

### Government Testing Role

- Support exists for government-led safety testing
- But concerns about technical competence of regulators (per Brookings research)

## Intersectional Concerns

### Gender and AI

- Women express greater concern about:
  - Privacy intrusion
  - Bias and discrimination
  - Government AI use
  - Workforce displacement

### Age and Knowledge

- Older demographics show lower AI knowledge
- Knowledge correlates with slightly different concern profiles
- Suggests demographic-specific messaging needed for policy communication

## Public Perception of Responsibility

### Who Should Address AI Harms?

- **Businesses bear substantial responsibility** for AI safety
- **Government responsibility** for broader regulatory frameworks
- **Shared responsibility** model preferred by majority

### Specific Issue Responsibility

**Government more responsible for:**
- Data privacy violations (88%)
- Misinformation spread (88%)
- Cybersecurity threats
- Deepfake electoral influence

**Business more responsible for:**
- Direct safety of products
- Transparency in operations
- Employee protections
- Customer safeguards

## Trust and Transparency

### Transparency as Essential

- Public willing to accept AI if transparency mechanisms exist
- Demand for explainability particularly high in sensitive domains

### Industry Trust Deficit

- Tech company leadership scores low in confidence ratings
- Demand for independent oversight reflects this deficit

## Competitive and Geopolitical Context

### International Competition Awareness

- Public recognizes need to compete internationally with AI
- But unwilling to sacrifice safety for speed
- Suggests policy should frame safety as enabling long-term competitiveness

## Policy Implications from California Data

1. **Privacy First**: Public prioritizes privacy over almost all other concerns
2. **Equity Anxiety**: Significant worry about algorithmic bias and discrimination
3. **Government Skepticism**: While wanting regulation, public doubts government competence
4. **Democratic Integrity**: Deep concern about election security in AI age
5. **Workforce Transition**: Support for worker protections indicates willingness for redistribution policies
6. **Multistakeholder Buy-In**: Rare bipartisan agreement on multistakeholder governance
7. **Safety Premium**: Public willing to accept slower development for proven safety

## Relevance to AI CEO Game

- California represents important political constituency—progressive on regulation
- Privacy concerns will drive consumer/regulatory pressure
- Equity concerns may require public commitments to bias testing
- Multistakeholder oversight expectations will shape corporate governance requirements
- Democracy/deepfake concerns will create political vulnerability points
- Worker protection demands will affect labor relations and public sentiment
