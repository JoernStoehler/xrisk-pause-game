### Economic Inequality Concerns

Public in many countries worried about:
- **Wealth concentration**: AI benefits accruing to few
- **Wage impacts**: Pressure on middle-class wages
- **Job quality**: Shift toward lower-wage work

## Regional and Cultural Variations

### English-Speaking Countries (US, UK, Australia)

- More skeptical of AI benefits
- Higher concern about risks
- Stronger regulation demand

### European Perspectives

- Vary by country but many express strong privacy concerns
- Generally support regulatory approaches
- Influenced by EU AI Act regulatory framework

### Developing Nations

- More varied perspectives
- Some see AI as competitive necessity
- Others see risks as exported Western problem
- Concern about data colonialism

### Asia-Pacific

- Mixed views on AI development
- Some emphasize competitive importance
- Others highlight social and labor concerns

## Regulatory Preferences Globally

### Demand for Oversight

- **71% globally** (October 2022) disagreed that AI regulation is unnecessary

## Artificial Superintelligence Concerns

### Existential Risk Awareness

When asked about likely causes of human extinction:
- **Robots/artificial intelligence scored 13%** — one point behind "bees dying out" (14%)
- Indicates existential risk has entered mainstream consciousness globally

### Variation in Existential Risk Concern

- Highest in Western developed nations
- Growing awareness in other regions
- But not uniformly distributed

## Generational Differences Globally

### Younger Cohorts
