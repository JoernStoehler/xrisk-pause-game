# Pew Research Center: US Public vs AI Expert Views on Artificial Intelligence (2025)

## Executive Summary

- **American public**: Only 17% hold this optimistic view
- **Inverse sentiment**: 51% of U.S. adults express more concern than excitement about increased AI use, compared to just 15% of experts
- **Expert excitement**: 47% of experts are more excited than concerned about increased AI use

### Concern Trajectories

- **Public concern growth**: 50% of Americans say they're more concerned than excited about AI (up from 37% in 2021)
- **Risk perception**: 57% of the public rates societal risks of AI as high
- **Benefit perception**: Only 25% of the public rate benefits of AI as high
- **Expert confidence**: 67% of experts view benefits as equal to or exceeding risks

## Specific Concerns

### Job and Employment Fears

- **Public**: 56% extremely or very concerned about AI eliminating jobs
- **Experts**: 25% express similar concern

### Regulatory Preferences

**Gallup parallel findings on regulation:**
- **80%** believe government should maintain rules for AI safety and data security
- **Only 9%** prioritize rapid development over safety measures
- **Cross-party consensus**: 88% of Democrats and 79% of Republicans/Independents support safety rules

## Knowledge and Information

### Expert Perspective

- Experts see broader positive applications across sectors
- More optimistic about rapid beneficial deployment timelines

## Demographic Variations

### Employment Status
