# AI Economic Impact and Job Automation: 2024-2025 Data Compilation

## Executive Summary

This document compiles findings from major economic analyses of AI's impact on jobs and the global workforce, covering both long-term projections and actual labor market data from 2024-2025. Key sources include Goldman Sachs Research, McKinsey Global Institute, and labor market statistics from multiple research organizations.

## Goldman Sachs Research Findings

### 2023 Major Predictions

Goldman Sachs' landmark 2023 forecast predicted significant disruption to the global workforce:

- **300 million jobs** in the U.S. and Europe were identified as susceptible to some level of change due to AI
- **Nearly one-quarter of jobs** across all industries are poised for automation by generative AI
- **Two-thirds of U.S. occupations** are exposed to some degree of automation by AI
- **Roughly one-quarter of current work** could be automated completely by AI

The original research drew parallels to previous technological revolutions, noting that the timing of a labor productivity boom is hard to predict. In both the electricity and computer revolutions, productivity booms started about 20 years after the technological breakthrough, at a point when roughly half of U.S. businesses had adopted the technology. Labor productivity growth rose by around 1.5 percentage points per year in the 10 years after the productivity boom started.

### 2025 Update: Actual Impact

A recent Goldman Sachs analysis (2025) reveals a stark reality: despite AI's rapid proliferation over the last couple years, **AI has had no discernible effects on major labor market metrics**. Goldman Sachs economists noted that "aggregate labor market impacts are still negligible."

**Key findings from the 2025 update:**

- It will be at least **two years** until AI-driven changes really manifest themselves in labor markets
- One notable exception: **unemployment among 20- to 30-year-olds in tech-exposed occupations** has risen by almost 3 percentage points since the start of 2025
- The lag between technological advancement and labor market impact is consistent with historical patterns

### Long-term Productivity Predictions

Goldman Sachs predicts that AI will eventually trigger a decade-long cycle of economic growth and productivity gains. The forecast suggests:

- Productivity improvements will take time to materialize, similar to previous technological revolutions
- When the boom does arrive, it could last approximately 10 years
- The impact will be most significant once AI adoption reaches critical mass (approximately 50% of businesses)

## McKinsey Global Institute Research

### Automation Potential

McKinsey's research indicates substantial automation potential across the economy:

- **57% of U.S. work hours** could theoretically be automated by current technologies (technical potential)
- **By 2030, 27% of current work hours in Europe and 30% in the United States** could be automated
- This represents activities, not necessarily complete job elimination
- Generative AI has significantly accelerated these timelines

McKinsey emphasizes that this high figure measures **technical potential in tasks**, not the inevitable loss of jobs. The distinction between automatable tasks and job elimination is crucial.

### "Agents, Robots, and Us" Report (November 2025)

McKinsey's most recent analysis examines the partnership between humans and AI:

- **40% of total jobs** are at the most automatable end of the spectrum
- Many of these jobs are likely to **evolve rather than disappear** outright
- The future of work will be defined by **partnerships among people, agents, and robots**
- At the task level, agents or robots could automate activities making up **57% of U.S. work hours**

### Impact on Cognitive Work

A significant finding is AI's effect on knowledge workers:

- By 2030, approximately 27-30% of current work hours could be automated
- Generative AI is **enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work** rather than eliminating jobs
- The technology augments rather than replaces these workers in most cases

### Skills and Workforce Transformation

McKinsey identifies several critical shifts in required skills:

- **Demand for "AI fluency"** has grown **sevenfold in two years**, faster than for any other skill in U.S. job postings
- More **social and emotional skills** will be required
- More **advanced cognitive capabilities** such as logical reasoning and creativity will be needed
- The skills shift represents transformation rather than simple displacement

### Economic Value

McKinsey estimates AI's massive potential economic value at approximately **$2.9 trillion** in the U.S. alone. Capturing this value requires workforce adaptation and skills development.

## Actual Job Displacement Data: 2024-2025

### 2024 Job Losses and Gains

Concrete data from 2024 provides the first clear picture of AI's actual labor market impact:

- **12,700 jobs** were lost due to AI in 2024 (according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, & Christmas)
- **119,900 direct jobs** were created by AI in 2024, including:
  - AI development roles
  - Data center construction
  - AI infrastructure and support positions
- **Net job creation: +107,200 jobs** in 2024 from AI

### Current Displacement Rates (2025)

Recent surveys and studies reveal varied impacts across demographics:

- **14% of all workers** have already been displaced by AI
- The rate is **higher among younger and mid-career workers** in tech and creative fields
- **Entry-level jobs** are especially at risk, with nearly **50 million U.S. jobs** affected
- Entry-level positions, disproportionately filled by young workers, face the greatest immediate threat

### Unemployment Correlations (2022-2025)

Analysis of unemployment trends by occupation reveals:

- Occupations that embraced generative AI most intensively showed the **largest unemployment gains**
- **Correlation coefficient of 0.57** between AI exposure and unemployment increases
- **Computer and mathematical occupations** (approximately 80% AI-exposed) saw some of the **steepest unemployment rises**
- This represents one of the first empirical confirmations of AI's labor market impact

### Gender Disparities

AI automation risk is not evenly distributed across genders:

- **79% of employed women** in the U.S. work in jobs at high risk of automation
- **58% of employed men** face high automation risk
- **58.87 million women** in the US workforce occupy positions highly exposed to AI automation
- **48.62 million men** face similar exposure
- This represents a significant gender disparity in AI risk exposure

### Geographic and Demographic Patterns

The impact varies by location and demographic factors:

- Tech hubs see earlier and more significant impacts
- Younger workers (20-30) in tech-exposed occupations experience higher unemployment
- Educational attainment affects both exposure and adaptability to AI-driven changes

## Future Projections

### World Economic Forum Estimates

Global projections suggest a complex transformation:

- **85 million jobs** will be displaced by 2025 globally
- **97 million new roles** will emerge simultaneously
- **Net positive job creation: 12 million positions** globally

This represents a **restructuring** of the labor market rather than net job loss, though individuals will experience significant disruption during the transition.

### Timeline Expectations

Based on historical precedent and current trends:

- **2025-2027**: Minimal aggregate labor market impacts (consistent with Goldman Sachs forecast)
- **2027-2030**: Acceleration of automation, particularly in knowledge work
- **2030-2040**: Productivity boom period, assuming sufficient adoption
- **Long-term**: Transformation of most jobs rather than mass unemployment

## Key Uncertainties

Several factors could significantly alter these projections:

1. **Pace of AI capability advancement**: Faster-than-expected progress could accelerate timelines
2. **Regulatory responses**: Government policies could slow or redirect AI deployment
3. **Adoption rates**: Business adoption patterns will determine actual vs. potential automation
4. **Economic conditions**: Recessions or booms could accelerate or slow AI-driven workforce changes
5. **Social and political reactions**: Public resistance could constrain AI deployment
6. **Complementary innovations**: Additional technologies could amplify or mitigate AI's impact

## Implications for Policy and Workforce Development

The research suggests several critical needs:

1. **Reskilling and upskilling** programs at scale
2. **Education system transformation** to prepare for AI-augmented work
3. **Social safety nets** to support workers during transitions
4. **Investment in human-AI collaboration** models
5. **Attention to equity concerns**, particularly gender disparities

## Methodological Notes

**Goldman Sachs data**: Based on occupational exposure analysis and historical technology adoption patterns. The 300 million jobs figure represents positions with significant AI exposure, not necessarily elimination.

**McKinsey data**: Uses task-level analysis to estimate technical automation potential. Distinguishes between what *could* be automated technically and what *will* be automated in practice.

**Labor market statistics**: Based on unemployment data, job posting analysis, and employment surveys from 2024-2025. The 12,700 job loss figure comes from reported layoffs explicitly attributed to AI, likely underestimating indirect effects.

## Conclusion

The 2024-2025 data reveals a pattern consistent with historical technological transitions: significant lag between capability development and labor market impact, followed by accelerating transformation. While AI has created more direct jobs than it has eliminated so far, the transformative effects on existing roles, particularly in knowledge work, are beginning to materialize. The next 2-5 years will be critical in determining whether AI follows the optimistic trajectory of previous general-purpose technologies or creates more disruptive labor market changes.
