# Session Resume Packet

Jörn works across concurrent sessions. After switching away, assume other work
has displaced this chat from working memory. A packet should let him resume
safely without rereading the transcript; it is not a chronology, effort report,
or generic project summary.

State first whether the session is awaiting a Jörn-only answer/review/action,
continuing autonomously, complete, blocked, or being abandoned/restarted.

Include only what supports resumption:

- the full session objective and current focus;
- status within that scope and what materially changed;
- the controlling product, domain-model, architectural, or engineering distinction;
- the default continuation, or the exact blocker/request;
- evidence, validation, residual risk, and artifact links when they affect
  status or the requested judgment.

When waiting on Jörn, give the current recommendation and ask the smallest
question only he can answer. Explain what changes with the answer and identify
the exact review target. Otherwise say explicitly that the session is not
waiting on him.

Assume Jörn remembers nothing from the last turn, but omit command logs, broad
file lists, dead ends, and recently salient facts that do not change his next
action. Translate code symbols into the controlling project issue. An immediate
next command can be an execution cursor, but cannot replace objective, status,
and reason.

When replacing an inadequate earlier message, make the packet self-contained;
do not ask Jörn to mentally patch the old message with scattered corrections.

Read `references/design-notes.md` only when editing or diagnosing this skill.
