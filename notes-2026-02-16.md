Let's build!
- web game
- singleplayer
- single page app or what it's called
- mobile only, portrait mode
- tutorial modal on first play, that just shows (scrollable if longer than one screen) what to do
- end of game modal after utopia/extinction ending, that just shows (scrollable again) how the game end is to be interpreted
- setting modal (no need to scroll, all on one screen)
- single view

The Game View (layout is just a suggestion, more important what semantic information is available with what screen real estate)
- top bar:
  - current date e.g. 2031 March (whatever the US format of dates is)
  - game speed control (Pause, Slow, Normal, Fast, where we basically optimize for Normal)
  - setting wheel icon
  - top bar never covered by modals
- setting modal
  - light vs dark color scheme
  - sound effects on/off [if you don't have music libraries or similar available, then this setting is a no-op)
  - music on/off
  - animations reduced/normal
- progress bar on top:
  - safety research progress meter (fills up as play progresses, start at 0%, and at 100% victory)
- map area: 
  - world map (no antartica, so we can fit it on the top half of the remaining area as a rectangle ; no scrolling, can be stylized / not as fine as a real map ) ; events have coordinates that fit the narrative, but we don't need to be precise or anything ; an event in paris should be somewhere in france though ideally ;)
  - three different regions on the world map : US, China (vs Rest Of The World) [need not be exact, but kudos if it isn't making geography nerds cringe] ; maybe use as texture the flag ? or some hue ? depends on what design style you go for!
  - plague-inc style event pins that appear & disappear and care clickable (causes an event modal to open)
  - plague-inc style numerical "damage notifications" i.e. number + one icon+color combination of the game metrics ; appear from event bubbles that pop aka disappear (no continuous bubble effects)
- diplomacy area
  - remaining area below world map, about half of screen / same size as map
  - scrollable if it becomes too large but ideally we make it not too large
  - shows the legal state of the pause treaty; each item is basically a "law" that treaty members (US, China, Rest of the World) can have in effect ; the state is I suppose inactive / china-only / us-only / both ; I ordered from tame to radical (we can do this as a progression i.e. it's just the question of where the US & China each are on a scale of Leftmost-to-Rightmost ?)
     - Monitoring: [ none ] [ hardware locks ] [ thermal satellites ] [ network hacking ] [ police investigations ] ( how rogue data centers can be found )
     - Consolidation: [ none ] [ manufacturing  ] [ data centers ] [ business chips ] [ consumer chips ] ( how big rogue data centers can grow without legal consequence )
    - Training: [ allowed ] [ registration ]  [ accreditation ] [ air-gapped facilities ] [ banned ]
     - Enforcement: [ none ] [ cooperation ] [ sanctions ] [ sabotage ] [ military ] ( how US & China semi-actively get each other and the rest of the world to comply )
  - shows the budget (some is directly supplied from US & China, some via the safety institute ) ; maybe discrete funding levels similar to legal (?) instead of sliders ?
     - Research: Genetic Enhancement, Brain Uploads, Alignment Theory, ML Interpretability [hmm, maybe do this as a merged list of icons? e.g. a green dna icon to signify "more genetic enhancement research is being done now" ? Use events to add/remove them, instead of a fine-grained budget mechanic)
     - Enforcement: similarly use icons to show what infrastructure has been accumulated, and events grow/shrink this, e.g. policeman-emoji, satellite-emoji, ... that show the increase in budget but also increase in effectiveness of various legal measures ?
     - so I guess this is more of a "staff" list than an actual budget.
